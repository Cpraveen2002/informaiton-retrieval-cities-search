tiruchirappalli (pronunciation (help·info)) (formerly trichinopoly in english), also called tiruchi or trichy, is a major tier ii city in the indian state of tamil nadu and the administrative headquarters of tiruchirappalli district. the city is credited with being the best livable city and the cleanest city of tamil nadu, as well as the fifth safest city for women in india. it is the fourth largest city as well as the fourth largest urban agglomeration in the state. located 322 kilometres (200 mi) south of chennai and 374 kilometres (232 mi) north of kanyakumari, tiruchirappalli sits almost at the geographic centre of tamil nadu state. the cauvery delta begins 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) west of the city where the kaveri river splits into two, forming the island of srirangam which is now incorporated into the tiruchirappalli city municipal corporation. the city occupies an area of 167.23 square kilometres (64.57 sq mi) and had a population of 916,857 in 2011.
tiruchirappalli's recorded history begins in the 3rd century bc, when it was under the rule of the cholas. the city has also been ruled by the pallavas, pandyas, vijayanagar empire, nayak dynasty, the carnatic state and the british. the most prominent historical monuments in tiruchirappalli include the rockfort at teppakulam, the ranganathaswamy temple at srirangam dedicated to the reclining form of hindu god vishnu, and is also the largest functioning temple in the world, and the jambukeswarar temple at thiruvanaikaval, which is also the largest temple for the hindu god shiva in the world. the archaeologically important town of uraiyur, capital of the early cholas, is now a neighbourhood in tiruchirappalli. the city played a critical role in the carnatic wars (1746–1763) between the british and the french east india companies.
the city is an important educational centre in the state of tamil nadu, and houses nationally recognised institutions such as national institutes of technology (nit), indian institutes of management (iim) national law universities  (nlu), and indian institutes of information technology (iiit) srirangam. industrial units such as bharat heavy electricals limited (bhel), golden rock railway workshop, ordnance factory tiruchirappalli (oft) and high energy projectile factory (hepf) have their factories in the city. the presence of a large number of energy equipment manufacturing units in and around the city has earned it the title of "energy equipment and fabrication capital of india". tiruchirappalli is internationally known for a brand of cheroot known as the trichinopoly cigar, which was exported in large quantities to the united kingdom during the 19th century.
a major road and railway hub in the state, the city is served by the tiruchirappalli international airport (trz) which operates flights to the middle east and southeast asia.
