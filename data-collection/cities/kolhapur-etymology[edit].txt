etymology[edit]
kolhapur is named after kolhasur, a demon in hindu history. according to history, the demon kolhasur renounced asceticism after his sons were killed by god for harassing people, and prayed to mahalakshmi that she would leave the area to him for a hundred years. he committed numerous crimes until the goddess returned after the hundred years were over and killed him for his sins. the dying wish of kolhasur was to name the place after him, which was granted and the place was named kolhapur. kolha stands for kolhasur and pur, a sanskrit word, means "city".
