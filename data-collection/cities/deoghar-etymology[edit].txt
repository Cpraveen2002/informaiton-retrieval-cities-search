deoghar is a hindi word and the literal meaning of ‘deoghar’ is abode (‘ghar’) of the gods and goddesses (‘dev’). deoghar is also known as “baidyanath dham”, “baba dham”, “b. deoghar”. the origin of baidyanathdham is lost in antiquity. it has been referred to as haritakivan or ketakivan in sanskrit texts. the name deoghar seems to be of recent origin and probably dates from the erection of the great temple of lord baidyanath. although the name of the builder of the temple is not traceable, certain parts of the front portion of the temple are said to have been built by puran mal, an ancestor of the maharaja of giddhour, in 1596. deoghar is a place of worship for lord shiva, in the month of shravan many devotees take ganga jal from sultanganj to deoghar for worship and they get the desired wish of their life.
