history[edit]
the city lies in the cultural region of braj and was a part of the surasena mahajanapada during the vedic age. it was subsequently ruled by the bigger kingdoms including the mauryas, guptas, scythians, kushans, indo-greeks, harsha before falling into the hands of  brahmin peshwa ,rajput rulers.
before the foundation of modern firozabad, the main city in the area was at chandwar, on the left bank of the yamuna a short distance southwest of firozabad. chandwar was a stronghold of the chauhan rajputs from an early date, which was founded by a ruler named chandrasen according to tradition. chandwar was conquered several times by the delhi sultanate, but its chauhan rulers seem to have repeatedly asserted their independence over a period of several centuries. one tradition holds that the final defeat of the king jayachandra by muhammad of ghor took place here, at the battle of chandwar. according to family traditions of the bhadaurias, another conquest of chandwar happened in 1246, which may be corroborated by the records kept by the sultanate, which mention the capture of an unnamed hindu stronghold in that same year. then, after the delhi sultan khizr khan came to power in 1414, his general taj ul-mulk received submission from "the infidels of chandwar" and then, in 1420, he sacked and looted chandwar as punishment of some sort. in 1452, chandwar was the site of a major battle between the delhi and jaunpur sultanates, which led to a three-year truce between the two empires.
the modern city of firozabad was founded c. 1566, when raja todar mal was returning from a pilgrimage to gaya and stopped at the village of asafabad (just southeast of modern firozabad). the villagers insulted him, and when the emperor akbar heard of this, he sent the eunuch firoz khwaja to demolish the town and build a new one. the city was built on lands belonging to several neighboring villages, including akbarabad, sukhmalpur, muhammadpur-gajmalpur, rasulpur, and pempur-raipur, and it was named firozabad in honor of its founder. firoz khwaja's tomb, built of white marble, is by the road to agra.
