History[edit]
history[edit]
moradabad was originally called chaupala. it was a stronghold of the katehria rajputs, who had built a mud-brick fort overlooking the ganges. little remains of the settlement from this period, except for some monuments to widows of the katehria chieftains. under the mughal empire, chaupala was the seat of a pargana; it is mentioned in the ain-i-akbari as being part of the sarkar of sambhal. it produced a revenue of 1,340,812 dams for the imperial treasury and it provided a force of 500 infantry and 100 cavalry to the mughal army.
the modern city of moradabad was founded by rustam khan dakhani, mughal governor of sambhal, during the reign of shah jahan. in 1624, raja ramsukh, leader of the katehrias, had rebelled and invaded the tarai region. the raja of kumaon had complained to shah jahan, who then sent rustam khan to deal with the disturbance. rustam khan did so "with great vigor": he not only captured chaupala and put ramsukh to death, but also refounded the city as rustamnagar (named after himself), building a new fort and great mosque and making the place his new capital. the ruins of which were still visible as of the early 20th century in the form of a wall along the riverfront. the mosque is also extant, with an inscription dated to 1632. the fort and mosque remain among the oldest major monuments in moradabad today.
the name "rustamnagar" was short-lived, however. shah jahan soon called rustam khan to his court and demanded an explanation for why he had exceeded his orders. in an attempt to placate the emperor, rustam khan said that he had named it muradabad in honor of the young prince, murad bakhsh. the emperor was satisfied and permitted rustam khan to remain in charge of the new city, which now came to replace sambhal as the mughal governors' capital, and the name muradabad (or moradabad) has been in use ever since.
