main articles: bijapur sultanate and siege of bijapur
bijapur first came under the influence of allaudin khalji, the sultan of delhi, towards the end of the 13th century, and then under the bahamani kings of bidar in 1347. in 1347, when the bahamani dynasty was established, it included southern and eastern parts of bijapur district. the supremacy of the bahaman's may be said to have ceased by 1489. at that time five shahi dynasties were born and one of them was "bijapur". the mughal emperor aurangazeb conquered bijapur in 1686 and it was under mughal rule up to 1723. in 1724 the nizam of hyderabad state established his independence in the deccan and included bijapur within his dominion. however, his acquisition on this portion was of brief duration, in 1760 it went into the hands of marathas.
in 1518, the bahmani sultanate split into five splinter states known as the deccan sultanates, one of which was bijapur, ruled by the kings of the adil shahi dynasty (1490â€“1686). the city of bijapur owes much of its greatness to yusuf adil shah, the founder of the independent state of bijapur.
the rule of this dynasty ended in 1686, when bijapur was conquered during the reign of mughal badshah (emperor) aurangzeb, who had in 1684 turned bijapur into a subah (imperial top-level province).
british colonial period[edit]
in 1724 the nizam of hyderabad established his independence in the deccan, and included bijapur within his dominions. in 1760, the nizam suffered a defeat by the marathas, and ceded the region of bijapur to the maratha peshwa.
after the 1818 defeat of the peshwa by the british in the third anglo-maratha war, bijapur passed into the hands of the british east india company, and was assigned to the maratha princely state satara.
in 1817, war broke out between the british and the marathas. by 1818, the whole of bijapur was occupied by the british and was included in the territory assigned to the raja of satara. in 1848 the territory of satara was obtained through the failure of heir and the british rule started. till 1884, the bijapur district had headquarters at kaladagi. bijapur was made headquarters in 1885.
post-independence[edit]
after independence, the movement for re-organisation of states gained further momentum and on 1 november 1956 a separate "mysore state" was formed. by the wish of the people it was renamed as "karnataka". thus, the district bijapur along with other kannada speaking areas became a part of "karnataka state" on 1 november 1956.
central government had approved the request to rename the city in october 2014 from bijapur to "vijayapura" on 1 november 2014.
