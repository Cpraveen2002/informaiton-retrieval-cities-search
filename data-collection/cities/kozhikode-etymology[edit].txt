Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the exact origin of the name kozhikode is uncertain. according to many sources, the name kozhikode is derived from koyil-kota (fort), meaning fortified palace. the name also got corrupted into kolikod, or its arab version qāliqūṭ and later its anglicized version calicut. the arab merchants called it qāliqūṭ (ipa: qˠaːliqˠːuːtˤ). chinese merchants called it kūlifo.
although the city's official name is kozhikode, in english it is sometimes known by its anglicised version, calicut. the word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from calicut. it is the historical capital of kerala as the history dates back to 1498 ad when vasco da gama landed in kappad, near calicut.
