two novels by john masters are set in the fictional town of bhowani. according to the author, writing in the glossary to the earlier novel, nightrunners of bengal, bhowani is an "imaginary town. to get a geographical bearing on the story it should be imagined to be about where jhansi really is - 25.27 n., 78.33 e." nightrunners of bengal is set during the indian rebellion of 1857 at "bhowani" (the title alludes to the mysterious distribution of "chapatis" to village headmen which preceded the revolt). bhowani junction is set in 1946/47 the eve of independence. in each novel the main character is a british army officer named colonel rodney savage, one of a succession of such men from the same family.
christina rossetti wrote a short poem about the fate of the skene family at jhansi during the indian mutiny. it is entitled "in the round tower at jhansi - 8 june 1857". it was published in 1862 in the same volume as her more celebrated poem "goblin market". some time afterward, rossetti discovered that she had been misinformed about the husband and wife's suicide pact in the face of a murderous and implacable enemy ('the swarming howling wretches below' the tower walls) which is the poem's subject, but did not delete it from later editions. jhansi is the centre of story in vrindavan lal verma's hindi novel 'jhansi ki rani'.  this novel tells the story of jhansi ki rani lakshmibai, who fought bravely in 1858-59 to save jhansi from the britishers's attack.
