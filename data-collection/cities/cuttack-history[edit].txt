history[edit]
the earliest written history of cuttack may go back to the keshari dynasty. as stated by the historian andrew stirling, present-day cuttack was established as a military cantonment by king nrupa keshari of keshari dynasty in 989 ce. stirling based his opinion on the madala panji, a chronicle of the jagannath temple of puri. the reign of maharaja markata keshari was distinguished for the stone embank built to protect the new capital from flood in 1002 ce.
historical and archaeological evidence suggests cuttack becoming capital of a kingdom founded by raja anangabhimadeva iii of ganga dynasty in 1211 ce. after the end of ganga rule, odisha passed to the hands of the suryavamsi gajapati dynasty (1434â€“1541 ce) under whom cuttack continued to be the capital of odisha. after the death of raja mukunda deva, the last hindu king of orissa, cuttack first came under muslim rule and later under mughals, who made cuttack the seat of the new orissa subah (imperial top-level province) under shah jahan.
by 1750, cuttack came under the maratha empire and it grew fast as a business centre being the convenient point of contact between the bhonsale marathas of nagpur and the english merchants of bengal. the term "attock te cuttack" (attock to cuttack) was first used to describe the extent of the maratha empire after they conquered cuttack in 1750 and attock in 1758. it was occupied by the british in 1803 and later became the capital of odisha division in 1816. from 1948 onwards, when the capital was shifted to bhubaneswar, the city remained the administrative headquarters for the state of odisha.
the introduction of the sharadiya utsav tradition in the city dates back to the visit of saint chaitanya in the 16th century when the consecration of the idol of durga by using the mask pattern was conducted in his presence at binod behari devi mandap.
the remains of the old moated barabati fort still exist in the heart of cuttack.
