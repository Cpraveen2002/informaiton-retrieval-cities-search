shimla (english:  /ˈʃɪmlə/; hindi: [ˈʃɪmla] (listen); also known as simla, the official name until 1972) is the capital and the largest city of the northern indian state of himachal pradesh. in 1864, shimla was declared as the summer capital of british india. after independence, the city became the capital of east punjab and was later made the capital city of himachal pradesh. it is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state.
small hamlets were recorded before 1815 when british forces took control of the area. the climatic conditions attracted the british to establish the city in the dense forests of the himalayas. as the summer capital, shimla hosted many important political meetings including the simla accord of 1914 and the simla conference of 1945. after independence, the state of himachal pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 princely states. even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the simla agreement of 1972. after the reorganisation of the state of himachal pradesh, the existing mahasu district was named shimla.
shimla is home to several buildings that are styled in the tudorbethan and neo-gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. the colonial architecture and churches, the temples, and the natural environment of the city attract tourists. major city centre's attractions include the shri hanuman jakhu (statue), jakhu temple, viceregal lodge, christ church, mall road, the ridge and annadale. the city centre's northernmost point is jakhoo and the southernmost location is annadale, the easternmost point is sanjauli and the western point is chotta shimla. the kalka–shimla railway line built by the british, a unesco world heritage site, is also a major tourist attraction. owing to its steep terrain, shimla hosts the mountain biking race mtb himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in south asia. shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in south asia. apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with several colleges and research institutions.
