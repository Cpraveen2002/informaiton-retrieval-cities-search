madhyamgram was one of the twelve feudal provinces of bengal. it was under pratapaditya roy, ruler of jessore during the mughal empire.
on 21 december 1757 mir jafar, the nawab of bengal, presented twenty-four parganas to the east india company as dowry which also included madhyamgram, under anwarpur pargana, adjacent to barasat.
the first railway line from madhyamgram to duttapukur was commissioned in 1882 and the station was called chandipur. madhyamgram was then named as majher gaon, probably because the area was situated between badu (chakradharpur mouza) and sajirhat (guchuria mouza).
the present narrow noai canal, now acting as a dividing border line between new barrackpore and madhyamgram, stretching from the south of ganganagar to sajirhat in the west used to be a wide river, once called labanyabati, which through colloquial transformation became the noai river, and after years of silt depositions, turned into noai canal.
at that time, anwarpur pargana was notable for its tobacco trade and a special sweet-smelling blended tobacco was manufactured in madhyamgram.
madhyamgram was also a big paddy growing area, and the labanya river was a medium of navigation for the exportation of those products. madhyamgram was also notable for its fine embroidery works that attracted appreciation from delhi and mumbai. many muslim families maintained a livelihood through those works.
