history[edit]
saharsa is part of the mithila region, which first gained prominence after settlement by indo-aryan tribes that established the mithila kingdom (also known as the kingdom of the videhas). during the late vedic period (c. 1100–500 bce), videhas developed as one of the major political and cultural centres of south asia, along with kuru and pañcāla. the kings of the videhas kingdom were referred to as janakas.
the videha kingdom was later incorporated into the vajjika league, which had its capital in the city vaishali, which is also located in mithila.
