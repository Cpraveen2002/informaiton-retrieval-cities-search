history[edit]
north dumdum municipality, established in 1870, comprised villages known as birati, nimta, kadihati, jangalpur patna, gouripur and a large area of what is now netaji subhas chandra bose international airport. in 1998, bisharpara gram panchayat and half of sultanpur gram panchayat were merged with the municipality.
with the partition of bengal in 1947, "millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile east pakistan." in the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. a few of them made their own arrangements, but "it was squatters who made the east bengali refugees famous or infamous." squatting (jabardakhal in bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. by 1949, there were 65 refugee colonies in the dum dum and panihati zone. the squatters were in a way “self-settlers” in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government/ administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres.
