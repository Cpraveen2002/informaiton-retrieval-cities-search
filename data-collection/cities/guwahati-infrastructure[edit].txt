the city has a comparatively high quality of life. a 2006 survey ranked guwahati 17th among all the large and medium-sized indian cities. the city provides competitive residential and working environments with beautiful landscapes, pleasant climate, modern shopping areas, modern apartments, and bungalows, and considerably developed social infrastructure. a centrally funded four-lane, ambitious east-west corridor will pass through guwahati and connect all the state capitals of northeast india. completion of the project will boost the vital upliftment of the whole region.

the city still needs attention to improve its infrastructure. funding from the asian development bank is providing assistance to improve guwahati's transportation infrastructure along with a substantial amount from jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission (jnnurm) for its development.
