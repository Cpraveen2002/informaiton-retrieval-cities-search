cooum river near its mouth in chennai city
chennai is located on the south–eastern coast of india in the north–eastern part of tamil nadu on a flat coastal plain known as the eastern coastal plains. its average elevation is around 6.7 metres (22 ft), and its highest point is 60 m (200 ft). chennai is 2,184 kilometres (1,357 mi) south of delhi, 1,337 kilometres (831 mi) southeast of mumbai, and 1,707 kilometres (1,061 mi) southwest of kolkata by road. two major rivers flow through chennai, the cooum river (or koovam) through the centre and the adyar river to the south. a third river, the kortalaiyar, travels through the northern fringes of the city before draining into the bay of bengal, at ennore. the estuary of this river is heavily polluted with effluents released by the industries in the region. adyar and cooum rivers are heavily polluted with effluents and waste from domestic and commercial sources, the coumm being so heavily polluted it is regarded as the city's eyesore. a protected estuary on the adyar forms a natural habitat for several species of birds and animals. the buckingham canal, 4 km (2.5 mi) inland, runs parallel to the coast, linking the two rivers. the otteri nullah, an east–west stream, runs through north chennai and meets the buckingham canal at basin bridge. several lakes of varying size are located on the western fringes of the city. some areas of the city have the problem of excess iron content in groundwater.

chennai's soil is mostly clay, shale and sandstone. clay underlies most of the city, chiefly manali, kolathur, maduravoyal, k. k. nagar, tambaram, mudichur, pallavaram semmencherry, alapakkam, vyasarpadi and anna nagar. sandy areas are found along the river banks and coasts, and include areas such as tiruvottiyur, george town, madhavaram, new washermanpet, chepauk, mylapore, porur, adyar, besant nagar and uthandi. in these areas, rainwater runoff percolates quickly through the soil. areas having hard rock surface include guindy, nanganallur, pallikaranai, alandur, jaladampet, velachery, adambakkam and a part of saidapet and perungudi. the ground water table in chennai is at 4–5 m below ground in most of the areas, which was considerably improved and maintained through the mandatory rain water harvesting system. of the 24.87 km coastline of the city, 3.08 km experiences erosion, with sand accretion along the shoreline can be noticed at the marina beach and the area between the ennore port and kosasthalaiyar river.
geology
chennai is classified as being in seismic zone iii, indicating a moderate risk of damage from earthquakes. owing to the geotectonic zone the city falls in, the city is considered a potential geothermal energy site. the crust has granite rocks indicating volcanic activities in the past. it is expected that temperatures of around 200 to 300 c° will be available if the ground were drilled 4 to 5 km deep. the region has the oldest rocks in the country dating back to nearly a billion years.
flora and fauna

the southern stretch of chennai's coast from tiruvanmiyur to neelangarai are favoured by the endangered olive ridley sea turtles to lay eggs every winter. a large number of cattle egrets, pond herons and other waterbirds can be seen in the rivers of cooum and adyar. about 75,000 birds migrate to chennai every year. marshy wetlands such as pallikaranai also play host to a number of migratory birds during the monsoon and winter. over 300 species of birds have been recorded in the city and its neighbourhood by members of madras naturalists' society since its inception in 1978.
guindy national park is a protected area within the city limits. wildlife conservation and research activities take place at arignar anna zoological park including olive ridley sea turtle conservation. madras crocodile bank trust is a herpetology research station, located 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of chennai. the city's tree cover is estimated to be around 64.06 sq km. the most dominant tree species is the copper pod, followed by indian beech and neem. a total of 121 species of trees belonging to 94 genera and 42 families are found in the city. nearly half of the native plant species in the city's wetlands have disappeared in recent years. the city, which had 85 percent of its area covered with aquatic plants until the 1970s, now has only 25 percent of its area covered with such plants.
environment conservation
chitlapakkam lake in the southern part of the city
chennai has three rivers and many lakes spread across the city. urbanization has led to the shrinkage of water bodies and wetlands. the quantity of wetlands in the city has decreased from 650 to only 27 currently. the chennai river restoration trust set up by the government is working on the restoration of adyar river. environmentalist foundation of india is a volunteering group working towards wildlife conservation and habitat restoration.
the encroachment of urban development on wetlands has gravely hampered the city's sustainability, and contributed both to the city's floods in 2015 and water scarcity crisis in 2019.
