etymology
bangalore is an anglicised version of the city's kannada name bengalūru (kannada: ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು, kannada pronunciation: [ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru] (listen)). it was the name of a village near kodigehalli in bangalore city today and was used by kempegowda to christen the city as bangalore at the time of its foundation. the earliest reference to the name "bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century western ganga dynasty stone inscription on a vīra gallu (kannada: ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು; lit. 'hero stone', a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). according to an inscription found in begur, "bengalūrū" was the place of a battle in 890 ce.
an apocryphal story states that the twelfth-century hoysala king veera ballala ii, while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. the grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "bengalūru". suryanath kamath has put forward an explanation of a possible floral origin of the name as derived from benga, the kannada term for pterocarpus marsupium (also known as the indian kino tree), a species of dry and moist deciduous trees that grows abundantly in the region.
on 11 december 2005, the government of karnataka accepted a proposal by jnanpith award winner u. r. ananthamurthy to rename bangalore to bengalūru. on 27 september 2006, the bruhat bengaluru mahanagara palike (bbmp) passed a resolution to implement the name change. the government of karnataka accepted the proposal and it was decided to officially implement the name change from 1 november 2006. the union government approved this request, along with name changes for 11 other karnataka cities, in october 2014. hence, bangalore was renamed to "bengaluru" on 1 november 2014.
