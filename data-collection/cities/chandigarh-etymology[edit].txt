etymology[edit]
the name chandigarh is a compound of chandi and garh. chandi refers to the hindu goddess chandi and garh means fortress. the name is derived from chandi mandir, an ancient temple devoted to the hindu goddess chandi near the city in panchkula district.
the motif or sobriquet of "the city of beauty" was derived from the city beautiful movement, which was a popular philosophy in north american urban planning during the 1890s and 1900s. architect albert mayer, the initial planner of chandigarh, lamented the american rejection of city beautiful concepts and declared, "we want to create a beautiful city..." the phrase was used as a logo in official publications in the 1970s and is now how the city describes itself.
