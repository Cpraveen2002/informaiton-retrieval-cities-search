newspaper publishing in mysore started in 1859 when bhashyam bhashyacharya began publishing a weekly newspaper in kannada called the mysooru vrittanta bodhini, the first of a number of weekly newspapers published in the following three decades. a well-known mysore publisher during wodeyar rule was m. venkatakrishnaiah, known as the father of kannada journalism, who started several news magazines. many local newspapers are published in mysore and carry news mostly related to the city and its surroundings, and national and regional dailies in english and kannada are available, as in the other parts of the state. sudharma, the only indian daily newspaper in sanskrit, is published in mysore.
mysore was the location of the first private radio broadcasting station in india when akashavani (voice from the sky) was established in the city on 10 september 1935 by m.v. gopalaswamy, a professor of psychology, at his house in the vontikoppal area of mysore, using a 50-watt transmitter. the station was taken over by the princely state of mysore in 1941 and was moved to bangalore in 1955. in 1957, akashvani was chosen as the official name of all india radio (air), the radio broadcaster of the government of india. the air station at mysore broadcasts an fm radio channel at 100.6 mhz, and gyan vani broadcasts on 105.6. big fm, radio mirchi and red fm are the three private fm channels operating in the city.
mysore started receiving television broadcasts in the early 1980s, when doordarshan (public service broadcaster of the indian government) started broadcasting its national channel all over india. this was the only channel available to mysoreans until star tv started satellite channels in 1991. direct-to-home channels are now available in mysore.
