madurai is built around the meenakshi amman temple, which acted as the geographic and ritual centre of the ancient city of madurai. the city is divided into a number of concentric quadrangular streets around the temple. vishwanatha nayak (1529–64 ce), the first madurai nayak king, redesigned the city in accordance with the principles laid out by shilpa shastras (sanskrit: śilpa śāstra, also anglicised as silpa sastra meaning rules of architecture) related to urban planning. these squares retain their traditional names of aadi, chittirai, avani-moola and masi streets, corresponding to the tamil month names and also to the festivals associated. the temple prakarams (outer precincts of a temple) and streets accommodate an elaborate festival calendar in which dramatic processions circumambulate the shrines at varying distances from the centre. the temple chariots used in processions are progressively larger in size based on the size of the concentric streets. ancient tamil classics record the temple as the centre of the city and the surrounding streets appearing liken a lotus and its petals. the city's axes were aligned with the four-quarters of the compass, and the four gateways of the temple provided access to it. the wealthy and higher echelons of the society were placed in streets close to the temple, while the poorest were placed in the fringe streets. with the advent of british rule during the 19th century, madurai became the headquarters of a large colonial political complex and an industrial town; with urbanisation, the social hierarchical classes became unified.
