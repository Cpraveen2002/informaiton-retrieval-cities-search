history[edit]
ludhiana was founded in 1480 by members of the ruling lodhi dynasty of the delhi sultanate. the ruling sultan, sikandar lodhi, dispatched two ruling chiefs, yusaf khan and nihand khan, to re-assert lodhi control. the two men camped at the site of present ludhiana, which was then a village called mir hota. yusaf khan crossed the sutlej and established sultanpur, while nihand khan founded ludhiana on the site of mir hota.
the name was originally lodhi-ana", meaning "lodhi town", which has since shifted from "lodiana" to the present form of ludhiana. the lodhi fort, or "purana qila", is the only surviving structure in the city from this period; located in the neighbourhood of fatehgarh, it was well-maintained under ranjit singh and the british after him, but then fell into disrepair. it was declared a state-protected monument in december 2013.
the semi centennial celebration of the american presbyterian lodiana mission was held in ludhiana from 3â€“7 december 1884.
