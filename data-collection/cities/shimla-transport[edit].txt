local transport in shimla is by bus or private vehicles. buses ply frequently on the circular road surrounding the city centre. like any other growing city, shimla is also expanding with new habitats in the vicinity. transport services in these areas are also expanding rapidly. tourist taxis are also an option for out of town trips. locals typically traverse the city on foot. private vehicles are prohibited at the mall, ridge, and nearby markets. due to narrow roads and steep slopes, the auto rickshaws which are common in other indian cities are largely absent.
