haridwar
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
meandering main ganga river, known here as neel dhara (left) and the ganga canal (right), passing through haridwar.
the modern name of the town has two spellings: haridwar and hardwar. each of these names has its own connotation.
in sanskrit, the liturgical language of hinduism, hari means "vishnu", while dwar means "gateway". so, haridwar translates to "the gateway to  vishnu". it earns this name because it is typically the place where pilgrim's start their journey to visit a prominent temple of  vishnu – badrinath.
similarly, hara could also mean "shiva". hence, hardwar could stand for "gateway to  shiva". hardwar is also a typical place to start a pilgrim's journey in order to reach mount kailash, kedarnath, the northernmost jyotirlinga and one of the sites of the smaller char dham pilgrimage circuit – all important places for worship for hindus.
according to legend, it was in haridwar that goddess ganga descended when shiva released the mighty river from the locks of his hair. the river ganga, after flowing for 253 kilometres (157 mi) from its source at gaumukh at the edge of the gangotri glacier, enters the gangetic plain for the first time at haridwar, which gave the city its ancient name, gangadwára.
