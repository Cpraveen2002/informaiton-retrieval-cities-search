national highway 48 passes through vapi. it is connected to all major cities. it is the only place from which one can visit daman and silvassa. city bus service is available.
to cater to industry, the city hosts what is called a "floating population". the vapi railway station on the mumbai-ahmedabad rail link of western railway has become the direct beneficiary in terms of revenues due to daily commuters. it is the only city connecting daman district with dadra and nagar haveli district.
a coast guard airport is running in daman where private charters can operate with prior permissions. it will also be one of the stations in the mumbaiâ€“ahmedabad high speed rail corridor, otherwise known as the 'bullet train project'.
