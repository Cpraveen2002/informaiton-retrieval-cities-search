geography[edit]
the kolong river, a tributary of the brahmaputra river, flows through nagaon and in the process divides the city into two distinct regions: nagaon and haibargaon.
nagaon is bounded on the north by the sonitpur district and the brahmaputra river. on the south, it borders the west karbi anglong district, dima hasao and hojai district. on the east it is bounded by east karbi anglong district and the golaghat district, while on the west it neighbours the marigaon district.
there are several beels, marshy areas and swamps in the district, including the regions of marikalong, potakalong, haribhanga, jongalbalahu, samaguri beel, gatanga beel urigadang and nawbhanga. these wetlands are former channels of the kolong and kopili rivers.
