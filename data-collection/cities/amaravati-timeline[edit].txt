in 2019, the new state government allocated a budget of only ₹500 crore and immediately stopped all running projects in the middle of construction that was started by the previous naidu government. the amaravati project has substantially slowed with no deadline in sight.
as of 2020, the fate of amaravati as the sole capital of andhra pradesh hangs in balance as the incumbent ysrcp government has proposed to move the executive and judicial components of the capital to visakhapatnam and kurnool respectively. there has been a continuing backlash from the farmers of the region against this decision of the government for the past 644 days. the agitators are still awaiting the chief minister's appointment for a plausible solution.
