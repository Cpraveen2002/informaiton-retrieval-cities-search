nahar singh stadium
the nahar singh stadium, which has approximately 25,000 seats, has hosted 8 international cricket matches and a league cricket match between mumbai heroes and bhojpuri dabbang of celebrity cricket league. however, owing to the poor condition of the grounds, international competitions have not been held there since 2017. in 2019, a $10.15 million (115 crore) haryana government project began to renovate the stadium and grounds. international matches are expected to resume in the facility by the early 2020.
