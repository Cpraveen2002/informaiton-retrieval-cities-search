Development[edit]
development[edit]
bhiwani was considered a deserted place. farming could be done with the help of rain. after every two or three years, there would be a drought. men, women, animals and birds suffered due to a lack of water and greenery. things changed when in 1893 a canal was first constructed in bhiwani.
it was a religious region, and gradually the people started taking part in politics and the indian struggle for independence. pandit neki ram, fateh chand, k.a. desai and babu gupta accounted for the growth of a branch of the congress party here in 1939. but now many multinational corporations are looking at bhiwani as a potential location for their local operations.
