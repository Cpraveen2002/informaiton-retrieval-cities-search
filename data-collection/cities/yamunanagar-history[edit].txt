this town was part of ambala district before it was made as separate district in november 1989. the place was earlier known as abdullahpur which was later renamed by the city's eminent people as jamnanagar and later on as yamunanagar. before independence, it was a small village with most of the population around the railway station, which increased as a result of migration of refugees from west punjab after the partition.
