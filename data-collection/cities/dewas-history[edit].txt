dewas was formerly the capital of two princely states of british india. the original state was founded in the first half of the 18th century by the brothers tukaji rao (senior) and jivaji rao (junior), from the puar clan of the marathas. they had advanced into malwa with the maratha peshwa, baji rao, in 1728. the brothers divided the territory among themselves; their descendants ruled as the senior and junior branches of the family. after 1841, each branch ruled its own portion as a separate state, though the lands belonging to each were intimately entangled; in dewas, the capital town, the two sides of the main street were under different administrations and had different arrangements water supply and lighting.
the senior branch had an area of 446 sq mi (1,160 km) and a population of in 62,312 in 1901, while the area of the junior branch was 440 sq mi (1,100 km) and had a population of 54,904 that same year. both dewas states were in the malwa agency of the central india agency.
dewas junior & dewas senior darbars (courts) were composed of many jagirdars, sardars, istamuradars and mankaris.
after india's independence in 1947, the maharajas of dewas (jr. & sr.) acceded to india, and their states were integrated into madhya bharat, which became a state of india in 1950. later, in 1956, madhya bharat was merged into madhya pradesh state.
