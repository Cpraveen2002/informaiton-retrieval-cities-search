a view of the avadi lake before renovation
avadi has a lake called paruthipattu lake. spread over 200 acres and 2.64 kilometres (1.64 mi) in length, the lake is located 23 kilometres (14 mi) away from the city, behind the tamil nadu housing board (tnhb) and thirumullaivoyal. it was once a source of water for farmland irrigation. the body of water attracts many birds throughout the year. however, in the recent decades it has lost most of its area to indiscriminate building and encroachment. the paruthippattu lake area was renovated with a budget of 32 crores and converted into an eco-park that officially opened on 19 june 2019. the renovation added recreational facilities, a 3-km-long walking track, a central plaza and various greenery, while addressing the issues of encroachment and sewage pollution that had affected the once-neglected lake.
