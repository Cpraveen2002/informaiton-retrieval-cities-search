^ the term chennai is often used to denote the chennai metropolitan area, colloquially applied for the wider area than just the city. this area includes the city/district of chennai, and adjacent parts from its three neighbouring districts. this wider usage of the term has been documented as far back as 1639, when the madras municipal corporation was created.
