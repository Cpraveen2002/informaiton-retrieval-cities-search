climate[edit]
silchar has a borderline tropical monsoon climate (köppen am) slightly too hot in the “winter” or “cool” season to qualify as a humid subtropical climate (cwa). during this “cool” season the weather is generally warm and dry with cool to mild mornings; however, the “wet” season begins early as the monsoon moves into the region during april, with the result that for seven months of the year silchar has very hot and humid weather with heavy thunderstorms almost every afternoon until the middle of october, when there is usually a brief period of hot and relatively dry weather before the “cool” season sets in during november.
