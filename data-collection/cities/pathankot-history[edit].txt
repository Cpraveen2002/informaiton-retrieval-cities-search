pathankot was the capital of nurpur state and its name was changed to dhameri (nurpur) during the akbar reign. the pathania clan of rajput derived its name from pathankot.
after independence[edit]
during partition, the initial plan by border demarcation committee was to place pathankot (part of gurdaspur district that time) into pakistan and shakargarh district into india. however, as a later fine tuning of decision vice versa was done i.e. shakargarh district was given to pakistan and gurdaspur district (along pathankot) was given to india.
