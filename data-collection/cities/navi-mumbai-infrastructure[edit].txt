basic infrastructure worth ₹40 billion (us$500 million) is already in place. the city boasts a reliable supply of electricity from various sources, and excellent motoring conditions, with numerous flyovers, broad roads, and parking lots. the main problem which the residents face is poor connectivity with mumbai, with only two road links between the two cities and a single rail line. a hovercraft service from vashi to colaba and the cbd to colaba did not succeed due to the high cost of tickets and maintenance. cidco is planning to relaunch its hovercraft service from vashi, belapur, nerul and airoli to gateway of india.
