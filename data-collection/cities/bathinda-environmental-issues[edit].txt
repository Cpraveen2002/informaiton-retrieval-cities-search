there has been increasing incidence of various types of cancer in and around bathinda. it is attributed to the presence of polluting industries and the indiscriminate use of modern pesticides and other toxic materials in farming. a 2007 epidemiological study found that the surface waters of bathinda are contaminated with arsenic, cadmium, chromium, selenium and mercury primarily due to the discharge of untreated waste water from surrounding industries. unscientific farming practices, that emerged after the introduction of green revolution, are also alleged to be a reason for growing incidence of not just cancer but also, high rates of spontaneous abortions, reproductive ailments, genetic deformities, anaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, fluorosis and a host of skin ailments including rashes and boils. many young couples are also reported to be migrating out to save their children from adverse effects. hence the government has completely banned the use of ground water in the city for drinking purposes.
in the cleanliness survey, conducted by the union ministry of urban development, bathinda scored an all-india rank of 79 and number 1 rank in punjab.
