the 13th chief minister of andhra pradesh n. chandrababu naidu envisioned amaravati to be the people-centric pioneer smart city of india, built around sustainability and livability principles, and to be the happiest city in the world. among the innovative features on the drawing board are navigation canals around the city, and connecting to an island in the krishna river. the government has envisaged an investment needed of us$2â€“4 billion for the development of the city.
the city is being designed to have 51% green space and 10% of water bodies, with a plan to house some of the most iconic buildings there. it is being modeled on singapore, with the master plan being prepared by two singapore government-appointed consultants. other international consultants and architects will then be brought in to give the city an international flavor.
