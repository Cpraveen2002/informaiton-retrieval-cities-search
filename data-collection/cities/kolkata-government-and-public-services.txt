kolkata is administered by several government agencies. the kolkata municipal corporation, or kmc, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 16 boroughs, which together encompass 144 wards. each ward elects a councillor to the kmc. each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. by means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets. as kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the kmc. the functions of the kmc include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.
kolkata's administrative agencies have areas of jurisdiction that do not coincide. listed in ascending order by area, they are: kolkata district; the kolkata police area and the kolkata municipal corporation area, or "kolkata city"; and the kolkata metropolitan area, which is the city's urban agglomeration. the agency overseeing the latter, the kolkata metropolitan development authority, is responsible for the statutory planning and development of greater kolkata. the kolkata municipal corporation was ranked first out of 21 cities for best governance and administrative practices in india in 2014. it scored 4.0 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3.
the kolkata port trust, an agency of the central government, manages the city's river port. as of 2012, the all india trinamool congress controls the kmc; the mayor is firhad hakim, while the deputy mayor is atin ghosh. the city has an apolitical titular post, that of the sheriff of kolkata, which presides over various city-related functions and conferences.
as the seat of the government of west bengal, kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local governing agencies, but also the west bengal legislative assembly; the state secretariat, which is housed in the writers' building; and the calcutta high court. most government establishments and institutions are housed in the centre of the city in b. b. d. bagh (formerly known as dalhousie square). the calcutta high court is the oldest high court in india. it was preceded by the supreme court of judicature at fort william which was established in 1774. the calcutta high court has jurisdiction over the state of west bengal and the union territory of the andaman and nicobar islands. kolkata has lower courts: the court of small causes and the city civil court decide civil matters; the sessions court rules in criminal cases. the kolkata police, headed by a police commissioner, is overseen by the west bengal ministry of home affairs. the kolkata district elects two representatives to india's lower house, the lok sabha, and 11 representatives to the state legislative assembly.

the kolkata municipal corporation supplies the city with potable water that is sourced from the hooghly river; most of it is treated and purified at the palta pumping station located in north 24 parganas district. roughly 95% of the 4,000 tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in dhapa, which is east of the town. to promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture is encouraged on the dumping grounds. parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.
in 1856, the bengal government appointed george turnbull to be the commissioner of drainage and sewerage to improve the city's sewerage. turnbull's main job was to be the chief engineer of the east indian railway company responsible for building the first railway 541 miles (871 km) from howrah to varanasi (then benares).
electricity is supplied by the privately operated calcutta electric supply corporation, or cesc, to the city proper; the west bengal state electricity board supplies it in the suburbs. fire services are handled by the west bengal fire service, a state agency. as of 2012, the city had 16 fire stations.
state-owned bharat sanchar nigam limited, or bsnl, as well as private enterprises, among them vodafone, bharti airtel, reliance, idea cellular are the leading telephone and cell phone service providers in the city. with kolkata being the first city in india to have cell phone and 4g connectivity, the gsm and cdma cellular coverage is extensive. as of 2010, kolkata has 7 percent of the total broadband internet consumers in india; bsnl, vsnl, tata indicom, sify, hathway, airtel, and reliance are among the main vendors.
