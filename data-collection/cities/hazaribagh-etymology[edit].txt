Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the name of the town 'hazaribagh' (हज़ारीबाग़) is derived from two persian words: hazar (هزار) meaning 'one thousand' and bagh (باغ) meaning 'garden'. hence the meaning of hazaribagh is 'city of a thousand gardens'. according to sir john houlton, however, the town takes its name from the small villages of okni and hazari – shown on old maps as ocunhazry. the last syllable in its name probably originated from a mango grove which formed a camping ground for troops and travelers marching along a military road from kolkata to varanasi, constructed in 1783 and the following years. the grand trunk road subsequently replaced this military road in the mid-19th century, but the layout differed at places, particularly around hazaribagh. a dilapidated watch tower meant to guard the military road is still visible on tower hill, near silwar. in common literature, native english author kajol aikat has also mentioned hazaribagh as the land of thousand gardens in his debut novel unsocial amigos.
