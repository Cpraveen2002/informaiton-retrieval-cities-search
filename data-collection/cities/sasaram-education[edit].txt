education[edit]
sasaram is the sixth most literate city in bihar, with rohtas being the most literate district in bihar.
there are four government colleges, although many students prefer to go to more developed cities for quality education, such as bangalore, new delhi, pune, patna, varanasi and puducherry, for higher education. a new engineering college has been set up in the region.
this place is also known for preparation of competitive exams at sasaram railway junction. according to earlier natives of this city, there was not proper electrification of city around 2007 - 2008 which hampered the studies of students seeking for competitive exams. indian railways had 24 hours power supply at sasaram junction. this led a small group of students to study there at night under electric lights.
