origin of name
the earliest records, such as kalhana's rajatarangini, mentions the sanskrit name shri-nagara which have been interpreted distinctively by scholars in two ways: one being sūrya-nagar, meaning "city of the surya" (trans) "city of sun"  and other being "the city of "shri" (श्री), the hindu goddess of wealth, meaning "city of lakshmi".
