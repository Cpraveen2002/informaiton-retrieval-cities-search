midnapore
Economy[edit]
economy[edit]
the economy of the undivided district, according to 1991 and 2001 census statistics, was overwhelmingly agrarian. being a district town, midnapore functioned in an ancillary role for the rural district as an administrative and judicial centre. as such many businesses and services revolved around this role, which naturally, has been adversely affected by the division of the district. midnapore still fills this role and has more physicians, lawyers, teachers, banks, and administrative offices than any other town in either east or west midnapore district. the medical sector is thriving with the addition of a medical college and the vidyasagar institute of health application. coaching centres that assist students enrolled in the regular and correspondence courses of vidyasagar university are also common.
poorer segments of this semi-rural society are involved in transportation, basic agriculture, small shops and manual labour for construction work.
however, the picture has changed lately. today, midnapore is a commercial and agricultural hub in the district of paschim medinipur. the majority is middle class, with a few upper-class people living in the posh neighbourhoods of the city. high rise towers are also becoming frequent in the city.
