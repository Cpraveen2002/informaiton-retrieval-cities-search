junagadh (pronunciation (help·info)) is the headquarters of junagadh district in the indian state of gujarat. located at the foot of the girnar hills, 355 kilometres (221 mi) southwest of ahmedabad and gandhinagar (the state capital), it is the seventh largest city in the state.

after a brief struggle between india and pakistan, junagadh voted to join india in a plebiscite held on 20 february 1948. it was a part of saurashtra state and later bombay state. in 1960, in consequence of the maha gujarat movement, it became part of the newly formed gujarat state.
