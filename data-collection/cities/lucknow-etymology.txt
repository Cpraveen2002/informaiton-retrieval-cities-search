etymology
"lucknow" is the anglicised spelling of the local pronunciation "lakhnau". according to one legend, the city is named after lakshmana, a hero of the hindu epic ramayana. the legend states that lakshmana had a palace or an estate in the area, which was called  lakshmanapuri (sanskrit: लक्ष्मणपुरी, lit. lakshmana's city). the settlement came to be known as lakhanpur (or lachhmanpur) by the 11th century, and later, lucknow.
a similar theory states that the city was known as lakshmanavati (sanskrit: लक्ष्मणवती,fortunate) after lakshmana. the name changed to lakhanavati, then lakhnauti and finally lakhnau. yet another theory states that the city's name is connected with lakshmi, the hindu goddess of wealth. over time, the name changed to laksmanauti, laksmnaut, lakhsnaut, lakhsnau and, finally, lakhnau.
