Etymology and other names[edit]
etymology and other names[edit]
the ancient name of thana was śrīsthāna. it appears as thāna in early medieval arab sources.
the name thane has been variously romanised as tana, thana, thâṇâ, and thame. ibn battuta and abulfeda knew it as kukin tana; duarte barbosa as tana mayambu. before 1996, the city was called 'thana', the british spelling of the city, until it was replaced with the more-local name.
