common hawk cuckoo at midnapur.
electricity is available in ample amount. with time, power outages are becoming more uncommon.most businesses and upper middle-class and rich households have backup generators and batteries that they use in times of outages.
water supply has become more consistent than the past. most of the water comes from the kangsabati river. the municipal water supply is free and ample; tap water is available for about an hour twice a day and is stored by those who can, in plastic, metal, or concrete reservoirs or in buckets. the water is of questionable purity prompting the proliferation of individual water purification units.
at present, most middle and upper class households have water pumps installed in their household for daily use, which allows them not to rely on the municipal water, preventing over exploitation of the river.
sewage disposal is a concern.  many of the lower income-communities in the city do not have adequate plumbing and must rely on refuse-collectors to haul out human waste.  not all drains are covered, causing a proliferation of disease causing flies and mosquitoes. since midnapore is drier than many other coastal and humid low-lying towns of west bengal, this problem is not as acute as it.
