dewas
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the name dewas is derived from the devi vaishini hill in the city, commonly known as tekri. the hill has a temple of the deities devi tulja bhawani, chamunda mata and kalika mata. the word dewas is believed to be a sandhi of the words dev (deity) and vas (abode in marathi), so dewas means house of the god. swami shivom tirtha wrote the history of the hill (tekriâ€‰) of dewas in his book, sadhan shikhar. inspired by the area, e.m. forster wrote the hill of devi in 1953.
the district takes its name from its headquarters town, dewas, which is said to be derived from the legend that dewas rests at the foot of a 300-foot (91 m) conical hill known as chamunda hill on whose summit is the shrine of goddess chamunda. the image of the goddess is cut into the wall of a cave, known as devi vashini or the goddess's residence. from this, the name dewas (dev-vas) seems to have been derived.
