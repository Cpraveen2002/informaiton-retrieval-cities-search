broadly speaking, the climate of agra is classified as bsh by the köppen-geiger climate classification system. this is the tropical and subtropical steppe climate, a major climate type of the köppen classification that occurs primarily on the periphery of the true deserts in low-latitude regions, forming a transition between the desert climate (bw), and the more humid subtropical and tropical climates.
the city features warm winters, sweltering and dry summers and a monsoon season. the agra district, from its proximity to the sandy thar desert to the west, is relatively dry, and has greater extremes of temperature than districts further east. the hot west wind, loo blows mainly during april, may, and june with great force and can cause fatal heatstrokes. the monsoon rains usually begin in the first week in july; and generally end in mid-september. however, the monsoons, though substantial in agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of india. the weather moderates by the middle of october. the region around agra, the northwest indo-gangetic plain is prone to extreme fog in the winter months, which is caused due to natural factors like low winds, low temperatures, availability of moisture apart from air pollution. this phenomenon often leads to big delays and sometimes cancellation of trains due to poor visibility. agra has high levels of air pollution and one of the worst aqis in india. in a study conducted by who using data from years 2010–2016, agra ranked as the 8th most polluted city in india, along with other nearby cities including delhi, kanpur and faridabad.

environment[edit]
the taj mahal has faced significant damage due to air pollution and sewage discharge into the nearby yamuna river. the white-marble taj mahal is turning yellow and green because of filthy air in the world's eighth-most polluted city. the taj mahal flanks the garbage-strewn yamuna river and is often enveloped by dust and smog from smokestacks and vehicles.
the yamuna river is one of the most polluted rivers in the world. agra is the second largest contributor to river yamuna's pollution, after delhi. the river's pollution has caused several problems for the taj mahal such as 'attacks by bugs and their green slime', foul stench and corrosion of taj mahal's foundation. the river has as many as 90 nalas or drains opening into it. though the municipality has claimed to stop 40 of these drains, the bigger ones, bhairon, mantola, balkeshwar nalas continue to discharge huge quantities of untreated waste water without any check. activists say that the yamuna river bed between itmad-ud-daula and the taj mahal has become a dumping ground for pollutants. polythene, plastic waste, leather cuttings from shoe factories, construction material, are all thrown into the river.
less than 7% of the agra district is under forest cover. the only major wildlife sanctuary near agra is keetham lake, also known as sur sarovar bird sanctuary. the lake has nearly two dozen varieties of migratory and resident birds. within the sur sarovar bird sanctuary is the agra bear rescue facility, which is india's first sanctuary for 'dancing' bears. operated by wildlife sos, free the bears fund and others, the facility has rehabilitate over 620 sloth bears, which were exploited by a nomadic tribe known as the kalandars as 'dancing bears', despite the practice being illegal since 1972.
