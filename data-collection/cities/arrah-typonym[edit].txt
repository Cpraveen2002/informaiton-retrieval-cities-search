according to a jain inscription found at masarh village near the town, arrah is mentioned there as aramnagar (transl. city of aramas). that "aramnagar" later become "arrah".
according to mythologies, the word "arrah" or "ara" is derived from the sanskrit word aranya, which means forest. it suggests that the entire area around modern ara was heavily forested in the old days. according to mythology, sage vishwamitra, the guru of rama, had his 'ashram' somewhere in this region. rama killed the demon taraka somewhere near arrah.
arrah has also historically been known as shahabad, a name given to it by babur in 1529, when he camped here after his victory against the afghans of bihar. the name "shahabad" means "city of the king" and was used in the former shahabad district.
