silchar municipal board is responsible for the municipal governance of the town. the municipal history of silchar goes back to 1865 when the town was made a municipality under the bengal district town improvement act, 1864. the municipality was composed to 8 european and 3 indian members, in addition to the chairperson and the vice-chairperson. this was later withdrawn in 1868.  in january 1882, silchar got a town committee under the bengal municipal act, 1876. mr. wright, the deputy commissioner, was the chairperson and babu jagat bandhu nag was elected by the committee members as the vice-chairperson. silchar had been divided into four wards - janiganj, ambicapur, tarapur, and malugram - but each ward had only 20-50 voters.
the town committee had limited powers to impose taxes, which constrained its funds and municipal activities. yet it carried out some important activities: road construction, creating tanks and cleaning older ones, making public latrines, removable of 'objectional' houses such as distillery and slaughter houses out the town, and draining of swamps to prevent diseases. in 1891, on recommendation of the deputy commissioner to the assam government, silchar was turned into a municipality. the first municipal elections in silchar were held in february 1900 but only 14.6% of the town was eligible to vote. 12 members were elected, who joined 2 ex-officio members and 6 nominated members to form the municipality. of these 20 members, 16 were indians and 4 were europeans.
from 1882 to 1912, the deputy commissioners were the chairpersons of the municipality. the chairpersons began to be elected from 1913 onwards. kamini kumar chanda and mahesh chandra dutta were the first elected chairperson and vice-chairperson of the silchar municipality. the municipality took decisions like construction and repair of roads, buying medicines and taking public health preventive steps, sanitation, and setting prices to guard again inflation. as the pro-independence sentiments grew, the municipality started to participate as well; reception plans for the viceroy chelmsford's visit to silchar in 1919 were cancelled because of the jallianwala bagh massacre, a resolution was passed after the death of chittaranjan das in 1925, and members of the municipality proposed a hartal to protest against the simon commission's visit to india in 1928. in 1930, the then chairperson dhirendra kumar gupta and member satindra mohan deb were arrested because of their participation in the civil disobedience movement. the municipality took out a resolution in july 1947 against including cachar within pakistan and sent a member to kolkata to submit a memorandum in front of the boundary commission.
by 1952, when the first post independence municipal elections took place, madhurban was added to the ward list and the town now had 5 wards in total. this period also saw the municipality giving over the control of the fire brigade to the state government, and donation  of land to establish educational institutes.
the area under the silchar municipal board was 10 km in 1971 and 15.75 km in 1971.
till 1975, the municipality had elected members, but from 1975 to 1979, a government executive officer was in charge. 1975 to 1984 saw an elected body preside over the municipal board, but from 1984, it has been run by state government appointees.
