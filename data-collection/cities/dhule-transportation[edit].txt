dhule- central bus stand
dhule is one of the few cities in the maharashtra state which is located on the junction of three national highways, these being nh-3, nh-6 and nh-211. through the asian highway project, portions of nh3 and nh6 passing through dhule have been converted into numbered asian highways ah47 & ah46 respectively.
due to the heavy use of central bus stand and traffic congestion within the city, one more bus stand has been built in deopur, which became fully operational from 23 march 2015. from this stand, about 120 route buses are running on a daily basis. central bus stand is connected to deopur bus stand by four 25 seater mini-buses by maharashtra state road transport corporation (msrtc). these buses run from central bus stand to nagav and from deopur bus stand to laling. recognizing ongoing expansion of the city limits and the increased population, shri annasaheb misal (ias), the collector & district magistrate of dhule and shri rajendra deore (dhule depot controller) of msrtc started city-bus services in july 2016. this service is available on four different routes - laling to nagav, fagne to morane, walwadi to vadjai, and cbs to chakkar bardi.
