etymology[edit]
the history of burdwan is known from about 5000 bc (the mesolithic or late stone age). the origin of this name dates back to the sixth century bce and is ascribed to vardhamāna or mahāvīra (599-527 bce), the 24th tīrthāṅkara of jainism, who spent some time in astikagrama, according to the jain scripture of kalpa sūtra. this place was renamed as vardhamana in his honour.
