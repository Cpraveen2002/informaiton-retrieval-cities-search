ahmednagar (pronunciation (help·info)), is a city located in the ahmednagar district in the state of maharashtra, india, about 120 km northeast of pune and 114 km from aurangabad. ahmednagar takes its name from ahmad nizam shah i, who founded the town in 1494 on the site of a battlefield where he won a battle against superior bahamani forces. it was close to the site of the village of bhingar. with the breakup of the bahmani sultanate, ahmad established a new sultanate in ahmednagar, also known as nizam shahi dynasty.
ahmednagar has several dozen buildings and sites from the nizam shahi period. ahmednagar fort, once considered almost impregnable, was used by the british to house jawaharlal nehru (the first prime minister of india) and other indian nationalists before indian independence. a few rooms there have been converted to a museum. during his confinement by the british at ahmednagar fort in 1944, nehru wrote the famous book the discovery of india. ahmednagar is home to the indian armoured corps centre & school (acc&s), the mechanised infantry regimental centre (mirc), the vehicle research and development establishment (vrde) and the controllerate of quality assurance vehicles (cqav). training and recruitment for the indian army armoured corps takes place at the acc&s.
ahmednagar is a relatively small town and shows less development than the nearby western maharashtra cities of mumbai and pune. ahmednagar is home to 19 sugar factories and is also the birthplace of the cooperative movement. due to scarce rainfall, ahmednagar often suffers from drought. marathi is the primary language for daily-life communication. ahmednagar has recently published a plan of developing the city by year 2031.
