jantar mantar
the jantar mantar observatory, constructed in 1737, is located above the ghats along the ganges, and is adjacent to the manmandir and dasaswamedh ghats and near the palace of jai singh ii of jaipur. while less equipped than the observatories at jaipur and delhi, the jantar mantar has a unique equatorial sundial which is functional and allows measurements to be monitored and recorded by one person.
ramnagar fort
ramnagar fort was built in 1750 by kashi naresh raja balwant singh.
the ramnagar fort, located near the ganges on its eastern bank and opposite the tulsi ghat, was built in the 18th century by kashi naresh raja balwant singh with cream-coloured chunar sandstone. the fort is a typical example of the mughal architecture with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. at present, the fort is in disrepair. the fort and its museum are the repository of the history of the kings of benares. cited as an "eccentric" museum, it contains a rare collection of american vintage cars, bejewelled sedan chairs, an impressive weaponry hall, and a rare astrological clock. in addition, manuscripts, especially religious writings, are housed in the saraswati bhawan which is a part of a museum within the fort. many books illustrated in the mughal miniature style are also part of the collections. because of its scenic location on the banks of the ganges, it is frequently used as an outdoor shooting location for films.
ghats
the ghats in varanasi are world-renowned embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. the ghats are an integral complement to the hindu concept of divinity represented in physical, metaphysical, and supernatural elements. varanasi has at least 84 ghats, most of which are used for bathing by pilgrims and spiritually significant hindu puja ceremony, while a few are used exclusively as hindu cremation sites. steps in the ghats lead to the banks of ganges, including the dashashwamedh ghat, the manikarnika ghat, the panchganga ghat, and the harishchandra ghat, where hindus cremate their dead. many ghats are associated with hindu legends and several are now privately owned.
many of the ghats were constructed under the patronage of the marathas, shindes (scindias), holkars, bhonsles, and peshwas. most are bathing ghats, while others are used as cremation sites. a morning boat ride on the ganges across the ghats is a popular tourist attraction. the extensive stretches of ghats in varanasi enhance the riverfront with a multitude of shrines, temples, and palaces built "tier on the tier above the water's edge".
the dashashwamedh ghat is the main and probably the oldest ghat of varanasi located on the ganges, close to the kashi vishwanath temple. it is believed that brahma created this ghat to welcome shiva and sacrificed ten horses during the dasa-ashwamedha yajna performed there. above and adjacent to this ghat, there are also temples dedicated to sulatankesvara, brahmesvara, varahesvara, abhaya vinayaka, ganga (the ganges), and bandi devi, which are all important pilgrimage sites. a group of priests performs "agni pooja" (sanskrit: "worship of fire") daily in the evening at this ghat as a dedication to shiva, ganga, surya (sun), agni (fire), and the entire universe. special aartis are held on tuesdays and on religious festivals.
the manikarnika ghat is the mahasmasana, the primary site for hindu cremation in the city. adjoining the ghat, there are raised platforms that are used for death anniversary rituals. according to a myth, it is said that an earring of shiva or his wife sati fell here. fourth-century gupta period inscriptions mention this ghat. however, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.
the jain ghat is believed to birthplace of suparshvanatha (7th tirthankara) and parshvanatha (23rd tirthankara). the jain ghat or bachraj ghat is a jain ghat and has three jain temples located on the banks of the river. it is believed that the jain maharajas used to own these ghats. bachraj ghat has three jain temples near the river's banks, and one them is a very ancient temple of tirthankara suparswanath.

mosques
alamgiri mosque
there are 15 mosques of significant historical value in varanasi. of particular note are the abdul razzaq, alamgir, bibi razia, chaukhambha, dhai nim kangore, fatman, ganje shahada, gyanavapi, and hazrat sayyed salar masud dargah. many of these mosques were constructed from the components of the hindu shrines which were destroyed under the auspices of subsequent muslim invaders or rulers. the two such well known mosques are the gyanvapi mosque and the alamgir mosque.
the gyanvapi mosque was built by the mughal emperor aurangzeb in 1664 ce, after destroying a hindu temple. gyan vapi (sanskrit: "the well of knowledge"), the name of the mosque, is derived from a well of the same name located within the precincts of the mosque. the remains of an erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque. the fa√ßade of the mosque is modelled partially on the taj mahal's entrance. the mosque is administered by the anjuman inthazamiya masajid (aim).
the alamgiri mosque was built in the 17th century by aurangzeb over the ruins of a hindu temple. the hindu temple that was destroyed was dedicated to vishnu, and had been built by beni madhur rao scindia, a maratha chieftain. when emperor aurangzeb had captured banaras, he had ordered total destruction of all hindu temples there. aurangzeb then built a mosque over the ruins of this temple in 1669 and named it as alamagir mosque in the name of his own honorific title "alamgir" which he had adopted after becoming the emperor of mughal empire. the mosque is located at a prominent site above the panchganga ghat, which is a funerary ghat facing the ganges. the mosque is architecturally a blend of islamic and hindu architecture, particularly because of the lower part of the walls of the mosque having been built fully with the remains of the hindu temple. the mosque has high domes and minarets. two of its minarets had been damaged; one minaret crashed killing a few people and the other minaret was officially brought down because of stability concerns. non-muslims are not allowed to enter the mosque. the mosque has a security cordon of a police force.
