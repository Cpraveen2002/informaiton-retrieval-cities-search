locomotive workshop[edit]
the jamalpur locomotive workshop was the first full-fledged railway workshop facility in india, founded on 8 feb  1862 by the east indian railway company. the jamalpur site was chosen for its proximity both to the sahibganj loop, which was the main trunk route at the time and to the communities of gunsmiths and other mechanical craftsmen in bihar.
the workshop was initially for repairing locomotives and assembling new ones from salvaged parts. by the early 20th century, however, it had progressed to producing its own locomotives. it produced the first one, ca 764 "lady curzon", in 1899. in 1893, it became the site of the first railway foundry in india. it also had a workshop for repairing and building boilers. today it has foundry, metallurgical lab facilities, and machine tool facilities. its rolling mill and nut and bolt shop ceased operation in 1984.
the school attached to the workshop eventually became the indian railways institute of mechanical and electrical engineering (irimee).
