on 12 april 2016, chief minister of haryana manohar lal khattar announced a proposal to officially rename the city gurugram (sanskrit: गुरुग्राम, lit. village of the guru), subject to the approval of the haryana cabinet and the union government. he argued that the new name would help to preserve the "rich heritage" of the city by emphasising its history and mythological association with drona. on 27 september 2016, he officially announced that the union government had approved the name change, and thus the city and district would henceforth be known as gurugram, though the old name "gurgaon" still lingers in the colloquial usage.
