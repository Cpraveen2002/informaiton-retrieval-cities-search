on 8 november 2014, punjab deputy cm sukhbir singh badal laid the foundation stone for a stadium in pathankot. but even after 6 years, the stadium is still incomplete. sportspeople struggle to get any facilities in pathankot. there are no proper grounds to practice. so they go to other cities, while most of the young population pursue other careers.
