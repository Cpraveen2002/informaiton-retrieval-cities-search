having patronage from the nawabs, artists from various field of arts sowed the seed of cultural heritage in this place. the calm lifestyle of this city still evokes a rich cultural environment. almost all well-to-do parents send their children to at least one school of art. among them, dancing, acting, recitation, painting, and music are the most popular.
elegant pieces of hand-craft arts can also be found in this region, namely the handcraft in making of carpet, bamboo and jute crafts, and miniature paintings.
this city can be considered one of the main cultural hubs of west bengal. 'rabindra sadan' named after bengal's very own nobel laureate rabindranath tagore is the place where most of the indoor cultural activities take place.
theatre groups like berhampore repertory theater, rangasram, chhandik, jugagni and prantik are based out of this town. these groups organise theatre festivals throughout the year mostly during the winter season. these festivals allow people from the city, nearby towns and villages to witness performances from different theatre groups from all over the state, different states and even groups from across the border of bangladesh. a relatively new theatre group, berhampore gangchil, has started their own productions focusing on junior school students.
