history[edit]
historically, bilaspur was part of dakshina kosala and was near capital of malhar, chhattisgarh (ancient mallar), sirpur (ancient shripura), tuman (ancient tummana), and ratanpur (ancient ratnapura). from 5th century onwards it was controlled by the kalachuri dynasty of ratanpur. ratanpur was historical capital of chhatisgarh state for many different dynasty. bilaspur city, however, came into prominence around 1741, the year of the maratha empire rule, when a maratha official took up his abode there to control dynasty of ratanpur.
the management of bilaspur district was taken over by the british east india company  in 1818 after bhosale lost territory in third anglo-maratha war. under bhosale of the nagpur kingdom there were many subedars or zamindars/landlords like akbar khan, vazeer khan, sao and others in bilaspur.
bilaspur district was constituted in 1861, followed by bilaspur municipality in 1867. famines in the bilaspur district were recorded by the british administration in 1828–9, 1834–5, 1845–6, 1868–9 and 1899–1900. in 1868-9 and 1899–1900, the rains failed almost completely, resulting in severe distress, migration and desertion of villages. after the 1868-9 famine there was prosperity for the next 25 years; but in 1895 there was a very poor harvest, followed in 1896 by a complete failure of crops, and severe famine continued throughout 1897. in that year the mortality rate was as high as one in six people. the famine of 1897 was followed by two favorable years; but in 1899 the monsoon failed completely and the rice crop was wholly destroyed.
guru ghasidas (1756–1836) started a religious movement, satnamis (meaning the worshippers of satnam), between 1820 and 1830 primarily around the sonakhan forests. this religious movement preached against idol-worship, and instead stressed that god is synonymous with truth. his community was a farming community. the university at bilaspur is named after him as guru ghasidas university.
railways arrived at bilaspur in the decade 1880–90, with the arrival of the bengal nagpur railway. in 1888 mistri jagmal gangji and other mistri railway contractors laid the first railway tracks from rajnandgaon to bilaspur, and in that same year fellow kutchi contractor khoda ramji and others built the line from bilaspur to jharsuguda, including the bridge over the champa river.
in 1890, the present railway station and yard were constructed by the gujarati railway contractor jagmal gangji. his son mulji jagmal sawaria was later given the title of "rao sahib" by the british for his contribution to the development of the town, railways and the district. jagmal block and jagmal chowk in the city are named after jagmal gangji sawaria.
in 1901, the population of bilaspur was 18,937 and it was the eighth-largest town in the central provinces of british india. in 1908, weaving of tasar silk and cotton clothes were recorded as the major industries of bilaspur.
