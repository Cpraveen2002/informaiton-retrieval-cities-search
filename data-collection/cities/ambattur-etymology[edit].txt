Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
this place is one of 108 shakthi sthals in the country. the amman temple (for the hindu deity durga) here is the fifty-first in the order, giving the locality the tamil name "aimbaththu onraam oor" (ஐம்பத்து ஒன்றாம் ஊர்), meaning fifty-first place/temple village, which later transmuted as ambattur. the goddess is worshiped in the form of vaishnavi.
ambattur is also called so because it was a collaboration of 51 small towns (ambathu onraam oor in tamil), from which the name ambattur was derived.
