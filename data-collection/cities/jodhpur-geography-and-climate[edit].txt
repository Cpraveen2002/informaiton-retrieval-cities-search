jodhpur has a hot arid climate (köppen bwh), just short of a hot semi-arid climate (köppen bsh) due to its very high potential evapotranspiration. although the average rainfall is around 362 mm (14.3 in), which falls mostly from june to september, it fluctuates greatly. in the famine year of 1899, jodhpur received only 24 mm (0.94 in), but in the flood year of 1917, it received as much as 1,178 mm (46.4 in). jojari river, a tributary of luni river, flows from banad to salawas in jodhpur urban area. a riverfront project is approved and is in planning for this river for 35 km length coming inside jodhpur urban area which is under nammi ganga project of ministry of jal shakti from january 2021, earlier this project was under jodhpur development authority. pin code of jodhpur is 342001 which comes under jodhpur postal division (jodhpur region).
temperatures are extreme from march to october, except when the monsoonal rain produces thick clouds to lower it slightly. in april, may, and june, high temperatures routinely exceed 40 °c. during the monsoon season, average temperatures decrease slightly, but the city's generally low humidity rises, which adds to the perception of the heat. the highest temperature recorded in jodhpur was on 25 may 1932, when it rose to 48.9 °c.
