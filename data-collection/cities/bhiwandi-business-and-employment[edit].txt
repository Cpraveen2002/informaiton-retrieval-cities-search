business and employment[edit]
the city of bhiwandi has the largest number of power looms and handlooms in the country. the majority of the population is employed in the power loom sector. the second-largest power loom, after the one in surat, is located in bhiwandi. since 2012, the city's textile industry has been in decline, partly caused by the sudden enactment of new goods and services taxes. another concern facing textile producers is a lack of contact with buyers, leading many to sell primarily to middlemen, mostly from gujrat, who charge significant markup prices. bhiwandi has also a red light area.
bhiwandi initially developed as an industrial hub for the textile industry, but more recently has hosted other industries and logistics sectors. bhiwandi is among asia's biggest warehousing hubs; its godowns are considered asia's largest. it is a major contributor to the logistic landscape of mumbai and india due to its close proximity to the nhava seva port of mumbai, india's financial capital. many e-commerce companies like amazon, flipkart, reliance industries, snapdeal, and fedex have branches in the city. the city is the next developed region for mmrda, which has developed other regions such as the bandraâ€“kurla complex, mumbai metro, monorail project, and eastern freeway.
bhiwandi's economy is divided into three sectors: textiles, groceries, and service (supplying, logging, and food delivery). during the covid-19 pandemic, small hotels faced significant challenges.
