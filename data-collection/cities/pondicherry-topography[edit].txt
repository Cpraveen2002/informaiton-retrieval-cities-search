Topography[edit]
topography[edit]
the topography of pondicherry is the same as that of coastal tamil nadu. pondicherry's average elevation is at sea level, and a number of sea inlets, referred to as "backwaters" can be found. pondicherry experiences extreme coastal erosion as a result of a breakwater constructed in 1989, just to the south of the city. where there was once a broad, sandy beach, now the city is protected against the sea by a 2-km-long seawall which sits at a height of 8.5 m above sea level. whilst there was an early seawall made by the french government in 1735, this was not "hard structure coastal defense" so much as an adjunct to the old shipping pier and a transition from the beach to the city,
today, the seawall consists of rows of granite boulders which are reinforced every year in an attempt to stop erosion. as a consequence of the seawall, there is severe seabed erosion and turbulence at the coastal margin, resulting in an extreme loss of biodiversity within the critical intertidal zone. whenever gaps appear as the stones fall into the continually eroding seabed, the government adds more boulders. pondicherry's seawall has also caused beach erosion to migrate further up the coast, to the fishing villages in puducherry and tamil nadu to the north of the city.
