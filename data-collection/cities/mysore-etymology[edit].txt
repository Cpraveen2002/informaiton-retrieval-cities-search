Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the name mysore is an anglicised version of mahishūru, which means the abode of mahisha in the vernacular kannada. the common noun mahisha, in sanskrit, means buffalo; in this context, however, mahisha refers to mahishasura, a mythical demon who could assume the form of either a human or a buffalo, and who, according to hindu mythology, ruled the ancient parts of mysore kingdom, known in sanskrit as mahíšhaka, centred at mahishapura. he was killed by the goddess chamundeshwari, whose temple is situated atop the chamundi hills, after whom it is named. 'mahishapura' later became mahisūru (a name which, even now, the royal family uses), and finally came to be anglicised as mysore by the british and maisūru/mysuru in the vernacular kannada language.
in december 2005, the government of karnataka announced its intention to change the anglicised name of the city to mysuru. this was approved by the government of india in october 2014, and mysore was renamed, along with twelve other cities, on 1 november 2014.
