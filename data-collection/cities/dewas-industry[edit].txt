industry[edit]
dewas was known for being a production centre of retail opium in the 1800s, as noted in the 1895 first report of the royal commission on opium. rapid industrialisation took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but due to inadequate infrastructure, the pace has slowed since the late 1980s. in recent years, some industries have closed their operations due to a shortage of sufficient infrastructure to support growth; there is a shortage of water due to excessive usage in previous decades.
the city has many industrial units providing employment to thousands of workers. the largest companies include tata, kirloskar and john deere. dewas is known as the soy capital of india and is a major part of the soy bean processing industry in the country.
due to its location above sea level at one corner of the malwa plateau, constant wind flows in the region are suitable for harvesting wind energy. there are more than 100 wind mills on a series of hills 13 km (8.1 mi) from dewas, generating around 15 megawatts of power. these were financed by a few private companies which sought a reliable power supply.
