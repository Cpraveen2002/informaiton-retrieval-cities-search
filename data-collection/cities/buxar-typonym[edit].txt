according to local traditions, the name buxar is derived from a lake in the town named aghsar (effacer of sin), which in course of time became baghsar and took the present form that is buxar. another vedic legend states that, a sage or rishi named besira transformed himself to take the look of a tiger to frighten durvasa rishi, and doomed by him to retain the form of tiger forever. in order to restore his hyman's form, bedsira  bathed in the holy pond of aghsar and worshipped garushankar. to commemorate this event the spot was called vyaghrasar and later became baghsar (the tiger's pond).
