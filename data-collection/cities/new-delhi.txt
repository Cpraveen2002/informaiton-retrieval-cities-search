new delhi (/ˈdɛli/ (listen), hindi: [ˈnəiː ˈdɪlːiː], naī dillī) is the capital of india and a part of the national capital territory of delhi (nct). new delhi is the seat of all three branches of the government of india, hosting the rashtrapati bhavan, parliament house, and the supreme court of india. new delhi is a municipality within the nct, administrated by the ndmc, which covers mostly lutyens' delhi and a few adjacent areas. the municipal area is part of a larger administrative district, the new delhi district.
although colloquially delhi and new delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the national capital territory of delhi, both are distinct entities, with both the municipality and the new delhi district forming a relatively small part of the megacity of delhi. the national capital region is a much larger entity comprising the entire nct along with adjoining districts in neighbouring states, including ghaziabad, noida, gurgaon and faridabad.
the foundation stone of new delhi was laid by george v during the delhi durbar of 1911. it was designed by british architects edwin lutyens and herbert baker. the new capital was inaugurated on 13 february 1931, by viceroy and governor-general irwin.
