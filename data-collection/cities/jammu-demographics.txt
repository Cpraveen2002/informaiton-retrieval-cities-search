main article: 1947 jammu massacres
the city of jammu had a significant muslim population prior to the partition of india, 30.4 per cent by the 1941 census. during the 1947 jammu massacres, which preceded and continued during the pakistan tribal invasion of kashmir, many muslims were killed and many driven away to pakistan. the estimates of the number killed in the whole province vary between 20,000 and 100,000. the killings were carried out by extremist hindus and sikhs, allegedly orchestrated by the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh, and aided and abetted by the state forces and the maharaja hari singh. as a result of the violence and migration, by 1961, about 17.2 per cent of the population in the city of jammu was muslim. the displaced muslims took refuge in the sialkot district and other parts of pakistani punjab. many prominent punjabi residents in pakistan, including politician chaudhry amir hussain, economist mahbub ul haq, air marshal asghar khan, journalist khalid hasan and singer malika pukhraj were from jammu. a large number of these refugees also returned and resettled in the territory.
