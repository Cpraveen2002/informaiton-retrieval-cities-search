cityscape
chennai is divided into four broad regions: north, central, south, and west. north chennai is primarily an industrial area. south chennai and west chennai, previously mostly residential, are fast becoming commercial, home to a growing number of information technology firms, financial companies and call centres. the city is expanding quickly along the old mahabalipuram road and the grand southern trunk road (gst road) in the south and towards ambattur, koyambedu and sriperumbdur in the west. central chennai comprises residential elements, but is primarily home to the downtown area, and surrounding areas, the most visited by travellers to the city. the financial district is also located here.
