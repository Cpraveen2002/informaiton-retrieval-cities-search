biodiversity

the ganga-jamuna doab, of which allahabad is a part, is on the western indus-gangetic plain region. the doab (including the terai) is responsible for the city's unique flora and fauna. since the arrival of humans, nearly half of the city's vertebrates have become extinct. others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced. associated changes in habitat and the introduction of reptiles, snakes and other mammals led to the extinction of bird species, including large birds such as eagles. the allahabad museum, one of four national museums in india, is documenting the flora and fauna of the ganges and the yamuna. to protect the rich aquatic biodiversity of river ganges from escalating anthropogenic pressures, development of a turtle sanctuary in allahabad along with a river biodiversity park at sangam have been approved under namami gange programme.
the most common birds found in the city are doves, peacocks, junglefowl, black partridge, house sparrows, songbirds, blue jays, parakeets, quails, bulbuls, and comb ducks. large numbers of deer are found in the trans yamuna area of allahabad. india's first conservation reserve for blackbuck is being created in allahabad's meja forest division. other animals in the state include reptiles such as lizards, cobras, kraits, and gharials. during winter, large numbers of siberian birds are reported in the sangam and nearby wetlands.
