during rajput era the king of chauhan dynasty sumershah had gone to the bank of the yamuna river in etawah, where he saw an incredible act of nature. he saw a goat and a wolf drinking water together on the bank of the yamuna. after seeing this incident, the king went to astrologers and consulted about the incident, who advised him to build a fort at the place where the wolf and the goat were drinking water together. according to astrological calculation, building a fort would benefit the king.when construction work of the fort started at the decided location, then, while digging foundation the laborers working there found a brick of gold and silver, which made them excited and they started shouting "eeet mili, eeet mili" after hearing which the place was named as "eeet aaya" which later turned into ‘etawah’.
etawah is still sometimes referred to as the city of bricks and both tradition and the appearance of the ground suggest that the modern city was founded on an ancient khera or town site, so that it is not improbable that the existence of old bricks or old brick kilns may have led to its present name. according to some scholars the region from bateshwar in district agra to bhareh was known as ‘ishtapath’ and there are a large number of temples of lord siva who was ‘isht dev’ of the people of that region. from the word ‘isht’ the town was given the name of ishtkapuri a reference to which is found in bhareshya puran.
