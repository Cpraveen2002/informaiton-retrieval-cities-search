although connected by railway since 1865, it was not until 1940 that the first modern industry appeared in ghaziabad. however, it was in the post-independence period that industry really expanded, with a further 22 factories opening in the four years after 1947. this development can be attributed to the influx of people from the newly formed pakistan and the relocation of businesses from what was now the pakistani province of punjab. john oakey and mohan ltd., one of india's largest concerns manufacturing coated and bonded abrasives, and originally functioning under the name of 'national abrasives' at rawalpindi was shifted here under the proprietorship of 'dyer meakins' in 1947. subsequently, the mohan meakin breweries were also set up in the year 1949. this period also saw the development of ghaziabad as one of india's most famous centres of the oil engines industry.
in 1967, the municipal limits were extended up to the delhi-up border. starting in the early 1970s, many steel-manufacturing units also came up in the city making it one of the primary industries of the city. this period also saw the emergence of the electronics industry, with the setting up of bharat electronics limited and central electronics limited over the years, planned industrial development saw participation from major industrial houses of the country including mohans (mohan nagar industrial estate, 1949), tatas (tata oil mills), modis (modinagar, 1933; international tobacco co. 1967), shri rams (shri ram pistons, 1964), jaipurias etc. and also significant participation through foreign capital in concerns such as danfoss india ltd.
