etymology[edit]
the city's name is believed to be derived from a portmanteau of "thanjam puguntha oor" (tamil: தஞ்சம் புகுந்த ஊர்) which means "the town where refugees entered", referring to the town's history of providing hospitality to newcomers. according to another local legend, the word thanjavur was derived from "tanjan", who was a demon who was killed on this very place and that asura asked to make a beautiful city there in hindu mythology and later the asura was slain in what is now thanjavur by the hindu god neelamegha perumal, a form of vishnu. the city's name "thanjavur" might also be derived from the name of a mutharayar king, "thananjay" or "dhananjaya". thananjaya (dhananjaya) added to -oor gives the name thanjavur. the kalamalla stone inscription (the first stone inscription) was made by the renati chola king, erikal muthuraju dhanunjaya varma of 575 ce.
