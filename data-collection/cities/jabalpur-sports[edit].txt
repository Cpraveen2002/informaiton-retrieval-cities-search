the city has two stadiums: ravishankar shukla stadium and rani tal stadium. it is generally accepted that while serving at jabalpur in 1875, colonel sir neville chamberlain developed a new variation of black pool by introducing coloured balls into the game in the british army officer's mess. this game was later dubbed snooker.
