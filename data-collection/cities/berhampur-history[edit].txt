history[edit]
jaugada, present 35Â km away from brahmapur on the banks of the rushikulya, was an ancient fort and city existing from 3rd century bc to 7th century ad. its existence before and after this time period cannot be ruled out. also called samapa, it was a provincial headquarter of maurya dynasty along with dhauli as evident from the edicts found at both places. specific history about the place and civilisation doesn't exist after the maurya dynasty and the fort is now buried.
the cult of buddhi thakurani originated along with the emergence of brahmapur town in and around 1672 ad. telugu lengayat dera (weaver) community, who came to mahuri on the invitation of raja saheb of mahuri to take up their profession of weaving, started ghata yatra (pot festival) for highlighting the divinity of mahamayee thakurani of his capital town brahmapur. the chief of the dera community, kota chandramani kubera senapati, led his community people to migrate to mahuri and brahmapur who settle down into their hereditary profession of weaving tussar silken products or patta matha. the ghata yatra was initiated for the purpose of highlighting the tradition of worshiping thakurani as well as to use it as a platform for sales promotion of their silken products.
in april 1923, a meeting of the 'utkal union conference' was held at brahmapur under the  chairmanship of kalpataru das. many congress workers took part in it. they supported the main idea of amalgamation of the odia areas under one administration, but differed on the course of action to be taken to fulfil the objective.
it's finally became a part of orissa province on 1 april 1936 by amalgamation of odia-speaking lands carved out from madras presidency along with ganjam district and other southern odisha regions.
