malerkotla in the district map of sangrur, punjab
malerkotla is a city and district headquarters of malerkotla district in the indian state of punjab. it was the seat of the eponymous princely state during the british raj. the state acceded to the union of india in 1947 and was merged with other nearby princely states to create the patiala and east punjab states union (pepsu).
when that political entity was reorganised in 1956, the territories of the erstwhile state of malerkotla became part of punjab. it is located on the sangrur-ludhiana state highway (no. 11) and lies on the secondary ludhiana-delhi railway line. it is about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from ludhiana and 35 kilometres (22 mi) from sangrur in sangrur district.
in 2021, the city along with some adjoining areas were carved out of sangrur district to form the malerkotla district.
