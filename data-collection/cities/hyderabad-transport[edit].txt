as of 2018, the most commonly used forms of medium-distance transport in hyderabad include government-owned services such as light railways and buses, as well as privately operated taxis and auto rickshaws. these altogether serve 3.5 million passengers daily. bus services operate from the mahatma gandhi bus station in the city centre with a fleet of 3800 buses serving 3.3 million passengers.
hyderabad metro—(a light-rail rapid transit system) was inaugurated in november 2017. as of 2020 it is a 3 track network spread upon 69.2 km (43 mi) with 57 stations, it is the second-largest metro rail network in india. hyderabad's multi-modal transport system (mmts), is a three-line suburban rail service with 121 services carrying 180,000 passengers daily. complementing these government services are minibus routes operated by setwin (society for employment promotion & training in twin cities). intercity rail services operate from hyderabad; the main, and largest, station is secunderabad railway station, which serves as indian railways' south central railway zone headquarters and a hub for both buses and mmts light rail services connecting secunderabad and hyderabad. other major railway stations in hyderabad are hyderabad deccan, kacheguda, begumpet, malkajgiri and lingampalli.
as of 2018, there are over 5.3 million vehicles operating in the city, of which 4.3 million are two-wheelers and 1.04 million four-wheelers. the large number of vehicles coupled with relatively low road coverage—roads occupy only 9.5% of the total city area—has led to widespread traffic congestion especially since 80% of passengers and 60% of freight are transported by road. the inner ring road, the outer ring road, the hyderabad elevated expressway, the longest flyover in india, and various interchanges, overpasses and underpasses were built to ease congestion. maximum speed limits within the city are 50 km/h (31 mph) for two-wheelers and cars, 35 km/h (22 mph) for auto rickshaws and 40 km/h (25 mph) for light commercial vehicles and buses.
hyderabad sits at the junction of three national highways linking it to six other states: nh-44 runs 3,963 km (2,462 mi) from srinagar, jammu and kashmir, in the north to kanyakumari, tamil nadu, in the south; nh-65, runs 841 km (523 mi) east-west between machilipatnam, andhra pradesh connects hyderabad and suryapet with pune, maharashtra; 334 km (208 mi) nh-163 links hyderabad and bhopalpatnam, chhattisgarh; 270 km (168 mi) nh-765 links hyderabad to srisailam, andhra pradesh. five state highways, 225 km (140 mi) sh-1 links hyderabad, to ramagundam, sh-2, sh-4, and sh-6, either start from, or pass through, hyderabad.
air traffic was previously handled via begumpet airport established in 1930, but this was replaced by rajiv gandhi international airport (rgia) (iata: hyd, icao: vohs) in 2008, capable of handling 25 million passengers and 150,000 metric-tonnes of cargo per annum. in 2020, airports council international, an autonomous body representing the world's airports, judged rgia the best airport in environment and ambience and the best airport by size and region in the 15-25 million passenger category.
