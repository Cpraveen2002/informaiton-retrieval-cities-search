mumbai consists of two revenue districts.
population density and elevation above sea level in mumbai, india (2010). mumbai is especially vulnerable to sea level rise.
mumbai is on a narrow peninsula on the southwest of salsette island, which lies between the arabian sea to the west, thane creek to the east and vasai creek to the north. mumbai's suburban district occupies most of the island. navi mumbai is east of thane creek and thane is north of vasai creek. mumbai consists of two distinct regions: mumbai city district and mumbai suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of maharashtra. the city district region is also commonly referred to as the island city or south mumbai. the total area of mumbai is 603.4 km (233 sq mi). of this, the island city spans 67.79 km (26 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370 km (143 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71 km (169 sq mi) under the administration of municipal corporation of greater mumbai (mcgm). the remaining areas belong to various defence establishments, the mumbai port trust, the atomic energy commission and the borivali national park, which are out of the jurisdiction of the mcgm. the mumbai metropolitan region which includes portions of thane, palghar and raigad districts in addition to greater mumbai, covers an area of 4,355 km (1681.5 sq mi). mumbai lies at the mouth of the ulhas river on the western coast of india, in the coastal region known as the konkan. it sits on salsette island (sashti island), which it partially shares with the thane district. mumbai is bounded by the arabian sea to the west. many parts of the city lie just above sea level, with elevations ranging from 10 m (33 ft) to 15 m (49 ft); the city has an average elevation of 14 m (46 ft). northern mumbai (salsette) is hilly, and the highest point in the city is 450 m (1,476 ft) at salsette in the powai–kanheri ranges. the sanjay gandhi national park (borivali national park) is located partly in the mumbai suburban district, and partly in the thane district, and it extends over an area of 103.09 km (39.80 sq mi).
apart from the bhatsa dam, there are six major lakes that supply water to the city: vihar, lower vaitarna, upper vaitarna, tulsi, tansa and powai. tulsi lake and vihar lake are located in borivili national park, within the city's limits. the supply from powai lake, also within the city limits, is used only for agricultural and industrial purposes. three small rivers, the dahisar river, poinsar (or poisar) and ohiwara (or oshiwara) originate within the park, while the polluted mithi river originates from tulsi lake and gathers water overflowing from vihar and powai lakes. the coastline of the city is indented with numerous creeks and bays, stretching from the thane creek on the eastern to madh marve on the western front. the eastern coast of salsette island is covered with large mangrove swamps, rich in biodiversity, while the western coast is mostly sandy and rocky.
soil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. in the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy. the underlying rock of the region is composed of black deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants dating back to the late cretaceous and early eocene eras. mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. the area is classified as a seismic zone iii region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the richter magnitude scale may be expected.

mumbai is prone to monsoon floods, caused due to climate change that is affected by heavy rains and high tide in the sea, according to the world bank, unplanned drainage system and informal settlement is a key factor of frequent floods in mumbai. among other causes of flooding in mumbai is its geographic location, mumbai urban is in peninsular form, (a land-filled area that connects seven islands) a low laying area, compared to its suburb that sits on an elevated location, over the past few decades, the new informal settlements were formed in the suburb, causing a rapid increase in population, improper waste management, and drainage congestion. the rainwater from these areas heavily flows towards low-lying urban areas consisting of substantial slums and high-rise buildings. as a result, poorly constructed slums are either swamped, washed away, or collapse causing heavy casualties, and post-flood water logging lasts for a long time that causing blockage of railway lines-(most frequently used public transport in mumbai), traffic snarl, inundated roads, and sub-merged bylanes. over the past few decades, the frequency of floods in mumbai is enormous, the 2005 mumbai floods are characterized by 500-1000 deaths, household displacements, damaged infrastructure-(including heritage sites), and a financial loss of us$ 1.2 billion. in the process of reducing floods in mumbai, the maharashtra government adopted a flood mitigation plan; according to which the drainage system will be restructured, restoration of mithi river, and re-establishment of informal settlements. local civic body brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) authorities are assigned to forecast and issue eviction notices while bmc along with ngo's prepare for the evacuation of slum dwellers to temporary safe camps.

air pollution
air pollution is a major issue in mumbai. according to the 2016 world health organization global urban ambient air pollution database, the annual average pm2.5 concentration in 2013 was 63 μg/m, which is 6.3 times higher than that recommended by the who air quality guidelines for the annual mean pm2.5. the central pollution control board for the government of india and the consulate general of the united states, mumbai monitor and publicly share real-time air quality data. in december 2019, iit bombay, in partnership with the mckelvey school of engineering of washington university in st. louis, launched the aerosol and air quality research facility to study air pollution in mumbai, among other indian cities.
