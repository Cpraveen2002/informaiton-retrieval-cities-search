thiruvananthapuram is a relatively modern region with trading traditions dating back to 1000 bce. it is believed that the ships of king solomon landed in a port called ophir (now poovar) in thiruvananthapuram in 1036 bce. the city was the trading post of spices, sandalwood and ivory. however, the ancient political and cultural history of the city was almost entirely independent from that of the rest of kerala.
the chera dynasty governed the area of malabar coast between alappuzha in the south to kasaragod in the north. this included palakkad gap, coimbatore, salem, and kolli hills. the region around coimbatore was ruled by the cheras during sangam period between c. first and the fourth centuries ce and it served as the eastern entrance to the palakkad gap, the principal trade route between the malabar coast and tamil nadu. however the southern region of present-day kerala state (the coastal belt between thiruvananthapuram and alappuzha) was under ay dynasty, who was more related to the pandya dynasty of madurai.
the early rulers of the city were the ays. vizhinjam, which is now a region in the present-day thiruvananthapuram, was the capital of the ay dynasty. vizhinjam was an important port city from as early as the second century bc. during the ay dynasty's rule, thiruvananthapuram witnessed many battles in which the chola and pandyan dynasties attempted to capture the port town.
after the death of king vikramaditya varaguna in 925 ad, the glory of the ays departed and almost all their territories became part of the chera dynasty. during the tenth century, the cholas attacked and sacked vizhinjam and surrounding regions. the port in vizhinjam and the historic education center of kanthalloor sala were also destroyed by cholas during this period. a branch of the ay family, which had controlled the padmanabhaswamy temple, merged with the kingdom of venad in the 12th century.

present-day thiruvananthapuram city, district, and kanyakumari district, were parts of the ay dynasty during ancient and medieval ages, which was a tamil kingdom based in the southernmost part of the indian subcontinent. ay kingdom had experienced attacks and conquests by cholas and pandyas in various periods. later it became a part of venad in late middle ages, which was eventually expanded as the powerful kingdom of travancore in 18th century ce. the tamil-dravidian kind of architecture is also found in padmanabhaswamy temple, which makes it distinct and unique from the architectural style of temples in northern and central parts of kerala.
thambiran vanakkam was printed at kollam, the capital of venad in 1578, during the portuguese era. it holds the record of the first book printed in any indian language. it was written in the language lingua malabar tamul, which was spoken in southern kerala (kollam-thiruvananthapuram area) during the medieval period.
modern-day southern kerala (the districts like thiruvananthapuram, kollam, pathanamthitta, etc.) had been ruled by tamil dynasties such as the ay kingdom, the pandya dynasty, and the chola dynasty, for a long time until 16th–17th century ce. the official language of venad, based at kollam, was also identified as tamil, by the natives of venad in those times. the place names, the dialects of malayalam spoken, and the customs that exist in the southern parts of kerala still reveal a close relationship with tamil heritage. malayalam became more prevalent with the expansion of venad into travancore by annexing the regions up to present-day ernakulam district.
in the early 18th century ce, the travancore royal family adopted some members from the royal family of kolathunadu based at kannur, and parappanad based in present-day malappuram district. then, marthanda varma who inherited the kingdom of venad expanded the kingdom by conquering the kingdoms of attingal, kollam, kayamkulam, kottarakara, kottayam, changanassery, meenachil, poonjar and ambalapuzha. in 1729, marthanda varma founded the princely state of thiruvithamkoor and thiruvananthapuram was made the capital in 1795 after shifting the capital from padmanabhapuram in kanyakumari district. thiruvananthapuram became a prominent city in kerala under marthanda varma.

as a result of the annexation of neighbouring chiefdoms, the artists and scholars from these places migrated to thiruvananthapuram, turning it into a cultural center. marthanda varma gave patronage to different temple art forms including koothu, padhakam, kathakali, thullal, and koodiyattam. noted artists such as ramapurathu warrier and kunchan nambiar amongst others served as his court poets. travancore became the most dominant state in kerala by defeating the powerful zamorin of kozhikode in the battle of purakkad in 1755.
the city developed into a significant intellectual and artistic centre during this period. the city's golden age was during the mid-19th century under the reign of maharaja swathi thirunal and maharaja ayilyam thirunal. this era saw the establishment of the first english school (1834), the observatory (1837), the general hospital (1839), the oriental research institute & manuscripts library and the university college (1873). the first mental hospital in the state was started during the same period. sanskrit college, ayurveda college, law college and a second-grade college for women were started by moolam thirunal (1885–1924).
the early 20th century was an age of tremendous political and social changes in the city. the sree moolam popular assembly, established in 1904, was the first democratically elected legislative council in any indian state. despite not being under the direct control of the british empire at any time, the city featured prominently in india's freedom struggle. the indian national congress had a very active presence in thiruvananthapuram. a meeting of the indian national congress presided by dr pattabhi sitaramaiah was held here in 1938.
kowdiar palace built-in 1915 was the official residence of the travancore royal family.
the thiruvananthapuram municipality came into existence in 1920 as the first municipality in the travancore region. the municipality was converted into a corporation on 30 october 1940, during the period of chitra thirunal bala rama varma, who took over in 1931. the city witnessed multi-faceted progress during his period. the promulgation of the "temple entry proclamation" (1936) was an act that underlined social emancipation. this era also saw the establishment of the university of travancore in 1937, which later became kerala university.
with the end of british rule in 1947, travancore chose to join the indian union. the first popularly elected ministry, headed by pattom thanu pillai, was installed in office on 24 march 1948. in 1949, thiruvananthapuram became the capital of thiru-kochi, the state formed by the integration of travancore with its northern neighbour, the kochi. the king of travancore, chitra thirunal bala rama varma, became the rajpramukh of the travancore-cochin union from 1 july 1949 until 31 october 1956. when the state of kerala was formed on 1 november 1956, thiruvananthapuram became its capital.
with the establishment of thumba equatorial rocket launching station (terls) in 1962, thiruvananthapuram became the cradle of india's ambitious space programme. the first indian space rocket was developed and launched from the vikram sarabhai space centre (vssc) in the outskirts of the city in 1963. several establishments of the indian space research organisation (isro) were later established in thiruvananthapuram.
a significant milestone in the city's recent history was the establishment of technopark—india's first it park—in 1995. technopark has developed into the largest it park in the geographical area, employing around 62,000 people in 450 companies.
