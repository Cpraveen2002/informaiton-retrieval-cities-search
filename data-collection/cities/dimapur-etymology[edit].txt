dimapur
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the name dimapur is derived from the dimasa words; di means "water", ma means "large" and pur (sanskrit word) means "city", translating to "big-river-city", associated with the meaning of "kachari" which is "people of the river valley" and after the river which flows through it (dhansiri).
there are two accounts of the way in which dimapur got its name: many writers are of the opinion that the name 'dimapur' was derived from dimasa kachari words di-meaning water, ma-meaning big and pur-meaning city or township in the dimasa dialect; while others contend that dimapur is a corruption of hidimbapur, meaning the city of hidimbi (of mahabharata fame) - the rakshasi-turned-woman whose marriage to the pandava prince bhima led to the birth of ghatotkacha, which was the hindu lineage created for dimasa rulers by the brahmin pandits at khaspur. according to the second theory, the name hidimbapur is conjectured to have been abbreviated to dimbapur and subsequently to have lost a consonant to become dimapur. it is to be noted that dimasa kachari kingdom was at one point of time names as "heramba kingdom" in the ahom chronicles, dimapur is referred to sometimes as che-din-chi-pen (town-earth-burn-make) meaning ‘brick town’ and its rulers as timisa (distorted word for dimasa).
