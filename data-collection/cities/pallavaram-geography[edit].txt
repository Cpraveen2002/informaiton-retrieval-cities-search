pallavaram lake[edit]
pallavaram lake (or pallavaram periya eri, literally meaning 'big lake'), once a sprawling water body covering about 189 acres, has shrunk to a small patch on the lines of a pond on one side and a hillock of garbage on the other. the dumping of garbage from all the 42 wards of the pallavaram municipality for nearly a decade is the main reason for the shrinkage of the water body. nearly 25 acres had been lost to encroachments alone. the construction of pallavaramâ€“thoraipakkam road, a project initiated to connect chennai airport and rajiv gandhi salai, had split the lake into two halves. the portion of the lake on the southern side of the road has completely been covered by garbage. on the northern side of the road, the discharge of sewage from commercial establishments and homes and also effluents from some of the leather manufacturing units in nagalakeni has affected the quality of the water. this is one of the oldest palaeolithic culture site.
