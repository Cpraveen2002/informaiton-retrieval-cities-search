the city is bounded by the daya river to the south and the kuakhai river to the east; the chandaka wildlife sanctuary and nandankanan zoo lie in the western and northern parts of bhubaneswar, respectively.
bhubaneswar is topographically divided into western uplands and eastern lowlands, with hillocks in the western and northern parts. kanjia lake on the northern outskirts, affords rich biodiversity and is a wetland of national importance. bhubaneswar's soils are 65 per cent laterite, 25 per cent alluvial and 10 per cent sandstone. the bureau of indian standards places the city inside seismic zone iii on a scale ranging from i to v in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes. the united nations development programme reports that there is "very high damage risk" from winds and cyclones. the 1999 odisha cyclone caused major damage to buildings, the city's infrastructure and cost many human lives. floods and waterlogging in the low-lying areas have become common due to unplanned growth.

the bhubaneswar urban development area consists of the bhubaneswar municipal corporation area, 173 revenue villages and two other municipalities spread over 1,110 km (430 sq mi). the area under the jurisdiction of the bhubaneswar municipal corporation covers 186 square kilometres (72 sq mi). the city is somewhat dumbbell-shaped with most of the growth taking place to the north, northeast and southwest. the north–south axis of the city is widest, at roughly 22.5 kilometres (14.0 mi). growth in the east is restricted due to the presence of kuakhai river and by the wildlife sanctuary in the northwestern part. the city can be broadly divided into the old town, planned city (or state capital), added areas and outer peripheral areas. it is subdivided into units and colonies.
the old town or "temple town", the oldest part of the city, is characterised by many temples, including the lingaraja, nilakantha siva, rajarani and muktesvara temples, standing alongside residential areas. additional structures include the somabaresvara siva temple and the kartikesvara siva temple. the area is congested, with narrow roads and poor infrastructure. among neighbourhoods in the old town are rajarani colony, pandaba nagar, brahmeswara bagh, lingaraja nagar, gouri nagar, bhimatangi and kapileswara.
the planned city was designed in 1948 to house the capital. it is subdivided into units, each with a high school, shopping centres, dispensaries and play areas. while most of the units house government employees, unit v houses the administrative buildings, including the state secretariat, state assembly and the raj bhavan. private residential areas were later built in other areas of the planned city, including saheed nagar and satya nagar. unit i, popularly known as the market building, was formed to cater to the shopping needs of the new capital's residents. later, markets and commercial establishments developed along the janpath and cuttack-puri road at saheed nagar, satya nagar, bapuji nagar and ashok nagar. a dedicated institutional area houses educational and research institutes, including utkal university, the institute of physics, the institute of minerals and materials technology and sainik school. indira gandhi park, gandhi park and the biju patnaik park are located in the unit.
the added areas are mostly areas lying north of national highway 5, including nayapalli, jayadev vihar, chandrasekharpur and sailashree vihar, niladri vihar which were developed by bhubaneswar development authority to house the growing population. with the development of the new areas such as chandrasekharpur the city is now divided roughly into north(newer areas) and south bhubaneswar (older areas) by the nh-5 highway.
the peripheral areas are outside the municipal boundary or have subsequently been included within the extended boundary, including tomando, patia and raghunathpur. most of these areas were developed in a haphazard manner, without proper planning. the master planning branch of the bhubaneswar development authority developed the comprehensive development plan (cdp) in 2010. according to the odisha development authorities act, 1982, the development authority has control over the planning for municipal areas. apart from the cdp, bda has also created zonal development plans for some of the areas under the cdp. bhubaneswar secured the top rank in the smart city list in india.
