bidar
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the name of bidar appears to be derived from ‘bidiru’, which means bamboo.
legend has associated bidar with the ancient kingdom of vidarbha, to which references are found in early hindu literature like malavikagnimitra, mahabharata, the harivamsa, bhagavata, and a few other puranas.  its association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names bidar and vidarbha. this has been mentioned in firishta's writings.
the traditional tales reveal that vidura lived here; hence the place was earlier called viduranagara and also as the place where nala and damayanti (daughter of raja bhima, the king of vidharba) were meeting.
bidar under the rule of the bahmani sultanate was known as muhammadabad.
