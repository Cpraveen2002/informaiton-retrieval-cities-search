burdwan has a multi-cultural heritage. the deuls (temples of rekha type) found here are reminiscent of bengali hindu architecture. the old temples bear signs of hinduism, mostly belonging to the sakta and vaishnava followers.
the kankaleswari kali is also located in the city of burdwan. burdwan experienced and survived numerous violent conflicts, mainly due to mughal, pashtun and maratha invaders. the city of bardhaman was visited by notables of the delhi sultanate from raja todarmal to daud karnani, from sher afghan and kutub-ud-din to ajimuswan to the future mughal emperor shah jahan while he was still a rebel. bardhaman also has a number of bengali christians, and although they are a minority, there are many churches in the city.
