migrants[edit]
the educated, middle-income, and predominantly bengali populace lives in the old town area.
according to a study carried out by vidyasagar university, "most of these industrial units were located in riverine towns. a few of these were old towns inhabited previously by middle class bengali 'babus' while others were new towns grown out of agricultural lands... agriculture in bengal was more remunerative than work in the jute mills but what the jute mills paid was enough to attract labour from bihar, orissa, u.p. first and then from c.p. or even madras...the industrial 'mohallas' remained as 'ghettos'. there was little or no interconnection or social and cultural contact between local bengali population and the mill hands. both lived in their own worlds."
