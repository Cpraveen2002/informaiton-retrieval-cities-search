environment[edit]
solapur is one of the most-polluted cities in maharashtra due to the effluent chemicals produced as the waste products from the textile industries in its region. as many vehicles in the city utilise diesel fuel, it also generates tremendous smog emitted by sugar factories and heavy textiles industries in the city's suburb. various efforts are being made by maharashtra pollution control board (mpcb) to reduce air pollution and its environmental effects. the city has launched a go-green scheme by planting trees in the city and developing greenery with the help of various eco-friendly people in the city. cng will be available shortly soon in midc chincholi and some major area in solapur .
