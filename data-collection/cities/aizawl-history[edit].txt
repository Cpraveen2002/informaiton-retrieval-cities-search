History[edit]
history[edit]
in 1871â€“72, the disorderly conduct of khalkom, a mizo chief, compelled the british to establish an outpost that later became the aizawl village. the post had been established by suakpuilala, the chief of reiek and it was only 14 kilometres from sairang from where one could travel by flat bottomed boat. in 1890, officer dally of the assam police and his 400 men arrived at aizawl to support colonel skinner's troops during a british military operation against the mizo tribals. on dally's recommendation, aizawl was selected as the site of a fortified post that colonel skinner had been ordered to construct. the troops constructed stockades and buildings at the site. in 1892-95 aizawl became accessible from silchar by fair weather road under the supervision of major loch.
the indian air force carried out air strikes on the town during the march 1966 mizo national front uprising, following which the mnf withdrew to lunglei. until 1966, aizawl was a large village but the regrouping of mizo villages after the uprising made it become a larger town and then a city. aizawl has become the centre of road network in mizoram connecting the north and south, east and west. more than 25% of the mizoram population reside in aizawl.
