etymology[edit]
"asan", a species of tree which generally grows thirty meters tall, is found on the banks of the damodar river; "sol" refers to land. the name "asansol" is a combination of these two words. asansol is a city on the banks of damodar and its land is rich in minerals.
historically the city was anglicized as assensole during the british era but the name was reverted after independence.
