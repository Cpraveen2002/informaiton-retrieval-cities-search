once a home to many cottage industries, such as cotton and oil-ginning mills, there are now few industries that draw on local raw materials or skills. even the well known form of local articrafts, bidri ware, is in a state of decline. increasing prices of materials, especially silver, and declining sales have meant that many of the hereditary artisans are no longer employed in the production of such ware. bidar city has a large industrial area known as kolhar industrial area.
