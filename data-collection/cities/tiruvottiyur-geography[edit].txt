geography[edit]
tiruvottiyur is located at  wikiminiatlas13°10′n 80°18′e﻿ / ﻿13.16°n 80.3°e﻿ / 13.16; 80.3. it is an esplanade located on the shores of bay of bengal. sea encroachment was a major problem for fishermen before the building of groynes started in 2004. the groynes, put up over a length of 4 km, vary in length from 165 to 300 metres each, with a height four meters above the mean sea level. as the years have passed, some acres have been reclaimed with the formation of a beach as predicted.
as of 2018, the tiruvottiyur zone, along with the tondiarpet zone, has a green cover of under 10 percent, below the city's 14.9 percent average. this was chiefly because of numerous industrial units, mills, power plants, refineries, fishing harbours, and docks.
