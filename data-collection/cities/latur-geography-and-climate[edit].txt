latur is situated 636 metres above mean sea level, on the balaghat plateau, near the maharashtra–karnataka state boundary. it receives its drinking water from the nearby manjira river, which suffered from environmental degradation and silting in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. as a result of this and lack of implementation of a water management strategy, during the drought of the 2010s the city ran out of water.
temperature: temperatures in latur range from 13 to 41 °c (55 to 106 °f), with the most comfortable time to visit in the winter, which is october to february. the highest temperature ever recorded was 45.6 °c (114.1 °f). the lowest recorded temperature was 2.2 °c (36.0 °f). in the cold season the district is sometimes affected by cold waves in association with the eastward passage of western disturbances across north india, when the minimum temperature may drop down to about 2 to 4 °c (36 to 39 °f).
rainfall: most of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season from june to september. rainfall varies from 9.0 to 693 millimetres (0.35 to 27.28 in) per month. average annual rainfall is 725 millimetres (28.5 in).
recently, latur has been bearing the brunt of climate change. extreme weather episodes, including torrential rainfall and even hailstorms in summers, have been showing up in latur for over a decade now.
latur earthquake of 1993[edit]
main article: 1993 latur earthquake
on 30 september 1993, at 3:53 a.m. local time, latur was almost completely destroyed by a devastating intraplate earthquake that affected the southern marathwada region of maharashtra state in central-western part of india—including latur, beed, osmanabad, and adjoining districts about 400 kilometres (250 mi) south-east of mumbai—and resulted in a huge loss of life. the earthquake measured only 6.3 on the richter magnitude scale, but its focus was relatively shallow, at around 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) deep. consequently, the resultant shock waves, being unattenuated, caused more damage. the quake caused around 10,000 deaths  and 30,000 were injured, mainly due to the poor construction of stone houses and huts which collapsed on people who were fast asleep. after the earthquake, seismic zones were reclassified, and building codes and standards revised, all over india.
