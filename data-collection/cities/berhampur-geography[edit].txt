geography[edit]
the city is at 19° 20' n latitude 84° 50' e longitude. its average elevation above mean sea level is 24 m. the town stands on a rocky  ledge 78 feet above the mean sea level, surrounded by an extensive cultivated plain. in a direct line, the distance of the place from the sea is 11 km. on the east and south this plain is open and it slopes towards the sea but on the north and west, it is bounded by the mohiri or kerandi hills, some 2500 feet high and about 14 km from brahmapur.
brahmapur lies 25 km away from rushikulya river and in its basin. several small streams including sapua nadi and hati nadi flow through it.
a perfect amalgamation of odia and telugu communities can be seen here due to its being very near to the odisha–andhra border which turned itself into a major financial hub in southern odisha.
