history[edit]
many janapadas grew up along the old bhagirathi channel from the ancient times till around the 16th century: kalighat, boral, rajpur, harinavi, mahinagar, baruipur, baharu, jaynagar, majilpur, chhatrabhog etc. bipradas pipilai's manasavijaya, composed in 1495, mentions many places in this region. "chand sadagar, a merchant character of the manasavijaya, reached baruipur, from kalighat, through the old bhagirathi channel. from there he proceeded towards chhatrabhog, and then traveling through hatiagarh pargana reached the open sea". chaitanyadeva (1486â€“1534) also went through this route. travelling by boat to puri he halted at the village of atisara, near baruipur. "his last stoppage in 24 parganas was at chhatrabhog, now a village within the jurisdiction of the mathurapur police station. chhatrabhog seems to have been an important river-port on the old bhagirathi channel". rama chandra khan, the zamindar of chhatrabhog, helped chaitanyadeva to continue with his journey.
the area was home to the feudatory landlords (zamindars). the name rajpur has been thus derived from the bengali words rajar puri to rajpuri and in this form to the now rajpur. being on the banks of the adi ganga, rajpur was one of the major locations of bengal at that time. the proximity to kolkata's southern district and being on the banks of adi ganga, which is just across the river made the place to be well connected. the old zamindar's house in rajpur harinavi is like the roy choudhury's. the family stayed in rajpur. the ancestral houses of sarat chandra bose and subhash chandra bose were at kodalia, a neighbourhood in rajpur. both of them were members of the first 24 parganas district committee of the congress party, which was formed in 1921.
