after the battle of buxar the british took control over arrah. arrah was one of the centres of revolt in 1857.
during the indian rebellion of 1857, a group of 18 british civilians and 50 indian soldiers was besieged in the little house at arrah, by a band of 2500–3000 armed soldiers and around 8000 others under the command of 80-year-old veer kunwar singh, the zamindar of adjacent jagdishpur. a british regiment, dispatched to their assistance from danapur, was repulsed, but the group withstood the siege for eight days until they were relieved by other east india company troops.
