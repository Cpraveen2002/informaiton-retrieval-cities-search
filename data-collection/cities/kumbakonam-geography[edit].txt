the town of kumbakonam is surrounded by extensive paddy fields. methods of irrigation were considerably improved following the opening of the mettur dam in 1934. the fauna of the cauvery delta is limited to cattle and goats. the town is situated at the western flank of the kumbakonam-shiyali ridge which runs along the kollidam river basin separating the ariyalur-puducherry depression from the nagapattinam depression. this granular ridge projects further eastwards penetrating the puducherry depression and forms a hard layer of cretaceous rock underneath the sedimentary top soil.
