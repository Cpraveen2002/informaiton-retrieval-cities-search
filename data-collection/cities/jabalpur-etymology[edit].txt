Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
according to a prevalent theory, jabalpur was named after a sage named jabali, who meditated on the banks of the narmada river. another theory suggests an arabic origin of the word since jabal in arabic means granite boulders or huge boulders, which were common in the region. according to a fringe theory, the name refers to jauli pattala, a sub-divisional unit, mentioned in kalachuri inscriptions. jauli also refers to the huna queen of the kalachuri king, karna. it was spelled as 'jubbulpore' during british rule.
in 2006, the jabalpur municipal corporation renamed the city to jabalpur.
