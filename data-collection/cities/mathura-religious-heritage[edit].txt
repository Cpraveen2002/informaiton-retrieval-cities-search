most sculptures could be dated from the second century bc to the 12th century ce, thus representing a continuous period of about 14 centuries during which jainism flourished at mathura. these sculptures are now housed in the lucknow state museum and in the mathura museum.
the mathura museum is notable for archaeological artefacts, especially those from the kushan and gupta empires. it has sculptures associated with hinduism, buddhism and jainism.
