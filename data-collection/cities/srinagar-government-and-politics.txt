stray dog controversy
srinagar's city government attracted brief international attention in march 2008 when it announced a mass poisoning program aimed at eliminating the city's population of stray dogs. officials estimate that 100,000 stray dogs roam the streets of the city, which has a human population of just under 900,000. in a survey conducted by an ngo, it was found that some residents welcomed this program, saying the city was overrun by dogs, while critics contended that more humane methods should be used to deal with the animals.
the situation has become alarming with local news reports coming up at frequent intervals highlighting people, especially children being mauled by street dogs.
