cotton processing
with cotton being one of the major agricultural crops around bellary historically, the city has had a thriving cotton processing industry in the form of ginning, spinning and weaving plants.  the earliest steam cotton-spinning mill was established in 1894, which by 1901 had 17,800 spindles, and employed 520 hands. the city continues to thrive in this sector with one spinning mill and numerous cotton ginning and pressing mills, hand looms and power looms.
garment manufacture
bellari has a historic garment industry dating back to the first world war period, when the marathi speaking "darji" (tailor) community with its native skills in tailoring migrated from the current maharashtra region to stitch uniforms for the soldiers of the colonial british indian army stationed at bellary. after the war, the community switched to making uniforms for school children, and gradually the uniforms made here became popular all over the country. currently, bellari is well known for its branded and unbranded denim garments, with brands like point blank, walker, dragonfly and podium being successfully marketed nationally and internationally. there are about 260 denim garment units in bellary with nearly 3000 families working in these units.
