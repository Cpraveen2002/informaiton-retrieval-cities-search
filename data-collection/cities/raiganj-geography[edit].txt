raiganj is known for raiganj wildlife sanctuary (also called the kulik bird sanctuary), home to a large population of asian openbills and other waterbirds and it is the largest bird sanctuary in asia. raiganj is situated at the banks of kulik river which helped the town to become an important place for water connectivity. in course of time, the navigability of kulik river decreased and business through the waterway was stopped in the first half of the 1970s, especially after the dam was erected to prevent floods. the port area slowly lost its significance and, at present, it is the most backward locality of raiganj.
