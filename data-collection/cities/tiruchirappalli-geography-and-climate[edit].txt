tiruchirappalli is situated in central south-eastern india, almost at the geographic centre of the state of tamil nadu. the cauvery delta begins to form 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) west of the city where the river divides into two streams—the kaveri and the kollidam—to form the island of srirangam. by road it is 912 kilometres (567 mi) south of hyderabad, 322 kilometres (200 mi) south-west of chennai and 331 kilometres (206 mi) south-east of bangalore. the topology of tiruchirappalli is almost flat with an average elevation of 81 metres (266 ft). a few isolated hillocks rise above the surface, the highest of which is the rockfort; its estimated age of 3,800 million years makes it one of the oldest rocks in the world. other prominent hillocks include the golden rock, khajamalai, and one each at uyyakondan thirumalai and thiruverumbur.
apart from kaveri and its tributary kollidam, the city is also drained by the uyyakondan channel, koraiyar and kudamurutti river channels. the land immediately surrounding the kaveri river—which crosses tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile alluvial soil on which crops such as finger millet and maize are cultivated. further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil. a belt of cretaceous rock known as the trichinopoly group runs to the north-east of the city, and to the south-east there are layers of archaean rocks, granite and gneiss covered by a thin bed of conglomeratic laterite. the region falls under seismic zone iii, which is moderately vulnerable to earthquakes.

the city of tiruchirappalli lies on the plains between the shevaroy hills to the north and the palani hills to the south and south-west. tiruchirappalli is completely surrounded by agricultural fields. densely populated industrial and residential areas have recently been built in the northern part of the city, and the southern edge also has residential areas. the older part of tiruchirappalli, within the rockfort, is unplanned and congested while the adjoining newer sections are better executed. many of the old houses in srirangam were constructed according to the shilpa sastras, the canonical texts of hindu temple architecture.
climate[edit]
tiruchirappalli experiences a dry-summer tropical savanna climate (köppen climate classification: as), with no major change in temperature between summer and winter. the climate is generally characterised by high temperature and low humidity. with an annual mean temperature of 28.9 °c (84.0 °f) and monthly average temperatures ranging between 25 °c (77 °f) and 32 °c (90 °f), the city is the hottest in the state. the warmest months are from april to june, when the city experiences frequent dust storms. as of november 2013, the highest temperature ever recorded in tiruchirappalli was 43.9 °c (111.0 °f), which occurred on 2 may 1896; the lowest was observed on 6 february 1884 at 13.9 °c (57.0 °f). the high temperatures in the city have been attributed to the presence of two rivers—kaveri and kollidam—and the absence of greenery around the city. as tiruchirappalli is on the deccan plateau the days are extremely warm and dry; evenings are cooler because of cold winds that blow from the south-east. from june to september, the city experiences a moderate climate tempered by heavy rain and thundershowers. rainfall is heaviest between october and december because of the north-east monsoon winds, and from december to february the climate is cool and moist. the average annual rainfall is 841.9 mm (33.15 in), slightly lower than the state's average of 945 mm (37.2 in). fog and dew are rare and occur only during the winter season.
