history[edit]
nagercoil derives from the tamil expression nagaraja koyil, meaning "temple of nagas".
robert caldwell describes the extent of malayalam in the mid 19th century as extending from the vicinity of mangalore in the north where it supersedes with tulu and kannada to kottar beyond pahrali river near kanyakumari in the south where it begins to supersede with the tamil and from malabar coast in the west to western ghats in the east besides the inhabited islands of lakshadweep in the arabian sea. it was from the ancient trade centre of kottar from where the city of nagercoil began to expand.
known as the granary of travancore, nagercoil not only served as the food basket of kerala, but was also one among the important spice-trading centers in the kingdom of travancore from the 14th century onward, and maintained a trade network with arab merchants from the pre-islamic era. various tamil and kerala kings fought over this rich agricultural land, which boasted six rivers. various historians cite that the land's climate and diverse, luxuriant vegetation had no comparison anywhere else in tamil nadu.
the naturalist  jivanayakam cyril daniel (1927â€“2011) was born in nagercoil.
