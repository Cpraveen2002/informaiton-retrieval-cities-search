ancient history[edit]
the ancient name of alwar is salva or salwa (tribe).alwar was a part of the matsya kingdom, one of the 16 ancient mahƒÅjanapadas. in late vedic texts (such as the jaiminiya brahmana), the salva or salvi tribe is described as a non-vedic tribe that occupied kurukshetra and conquered the kuru kingdom
