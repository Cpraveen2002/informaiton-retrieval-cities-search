jorhat was the last capital of the ahom kingdom, as a planned town under royal patronage. it is often spelt as "jorehaut" during the british reign. in 1794, the ahom king gaurinath singha shifted the capital from sivasagar, erstwhile rangpur to jorhat. many tanks were built around the capital city by the ahom royalty such as rajmao pukhuri or borpukhuri, buragohain pukhuri, bolia gohain pukhuri, kotoki pukhuri and mitha pukhuri. this town was a flourishing and commercial metropolis but was destroyed by a series of burmese invasion of assam between 1817 and the arrival of the british force in 1824 under the stewardship of david scott and captain richard.
from the very first decade of the british rule, revolutionaries like gomdhar konwar,  dhananjay borgohain, jeuram dihingia baruah , and peuli phukan emerged. the british system of administration came into vogue in the year 1839 with an established police thana. during the great sepoy mutiny, maniram dewan and piyali barua were publicly hanged here in 1858.
in 1885, a narrow-gauge railway, jorehaut provincial railway, became operational. in time, this contributed to the rapid growth of the tea industry.
