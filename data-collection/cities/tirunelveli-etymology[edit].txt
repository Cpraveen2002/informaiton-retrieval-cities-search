etymology[edit]
tirunelveli is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the groves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. the region is believed to have been covered with venu forest and hence called venuvanam. tirunelveli was known in sambandar's seventh-century saiva canonical work tevaram as thirunelveli. swami nellaiappar temple inscriptions say that shiva (as vrihivriteswara) descended in the form of a hedge and roof to save the paddy crop of a devotee. in hindu legend, the place was known as venuvana ("forest of bamboo") due to the presence of bamboo in the temple under which the deity is believed to have appeared. the early pandyas named the city thenpandya nadu or thenpandya seemai, the cholas mudikonda cholamandalam and the nayaks tirunelveli seemai; it was known as tinnelvelly by the british, and tirunelveli after independence. the word tirunelveli is derived from three tamil words: thiru, nel and veli, meaning "sacred paddy hedge".
