the hesaraghatta lake in bangalore
bangalore lies in the southeast of the south indian state of karnataka. it is in the heart of the mysore plateau (a region of the larger cretaceous deccan plateau) at an average elevation of 900 m (2,953 ft). it is located at  wikiminiatlas12°58′44″n 77°35′30″e﻿ / ﻿12.97889°n 77.59167°e﻿ / 12.97889; 77.59167 and covers 741 km (286 sq mi). the majority of the city of bangalore lies in the bangalore urban district of karnataka and the surrounding rural areas are a part of the bangalore rural district. the government of karnataka has carved out the new district of ramanagara from the old bangalore rural district.
bangalore's topography is generally flat, although the western parts of the city are hilly. the highest point is vidyaranyapura doddabettahalli, 962 m (3,156 ft) above sea level, situated to the northwest of the city. no major rivers run through the city, although the arkavathi and south pennar cross paths at the nandi hills, 60 km (37 mi) to the north. river vrishabhavathi, a minor tributary of the arkavathi, arises within the city at basavanagudi and flows through the city. the rivers arkavathi and vrishabhavathi together carry much of bangalore's sewage. a sewerage system, constructed in 1922, covers 215 km (83 sq mi) of the city and connects with five sewage treatment centres located in the city's periphery.
in the 16th century, kempe gowda i constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. the kempambudhi kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. in the first half of the 20th century, the nandi hills waterworks were commissioned by sir mirza ismail (diwan of mysore, 1926–41 ce) to provide a water supply to the city. the river kaveri provides around 80% of the city's water supply and the remaining 20% is obtained from the thippagondanahalli and hesaraghatta reservoirs of the arkavathi river. bangalore receives 800 million litres (210 million us gallons) of water a day, more than any other indian city, but bangalore does face occasional water shortages, especially during summer and in years with low rainfall. a random sampling of the air quality index (aqi) of twenty stations within the city ranged from 76 to 314, suggesting heavy to severe air pollution around areas of high traffic.
bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and water tanks, the largest of which are madivala tank, hebbal lake, ulsoor lake, yediyur lake and sankey tank. however, about 90% of bangalore's lakes are polluted; the city government began revival and conservation efforts in december 2020. groundwater occurs in silty to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. the peninsular gneissic complex (pgc) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes granites, gneisses and migmatites, while the soils of bangalore consist of red laterite and red, fine loamy to clayey soils.
the city's vegetation is mostly large deciduous canopy and some coconut trees. many trees are frequently felled to pave way for infrastructure development. though bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone ii (a stable zone), it has experienced earthquakes of magnitude as high as 4.5 on the richter scale.
climate
bangalore has a tropical savanna climate (köppen climate classification aw) with distinct wet and dry seasons. due to its high elevation, bangalore usually enjoys a more moderate climate throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can make summer somewhat uncomfortable. the coolest month is january with an average low temperature of 15.1 °c (59.2 °f) and the hottest month is april with an average high of 35 °c (95 °f). the highest temperature ever recorded in bangalore is 39.2 °c (103 °f), recorded 24 april 2016, corresponding with the strong el niño in that year. the lowest ever recorded is 7.8 °c (46 °f) in january 1884. winter temperatures rarely drop below 14 °c (57 °f), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 36 °c (97 °f). bangalore receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons, and the wettest months is september, followed by october and august. the summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding. most of the rainfall occurs during the late afternoon or evening and rain before noon is infrequent. november 2015 (290.4 mm) was recorded as one of the wettest months in bangalore with heavy rains causing severe flooding in some areas, and closure of a number of organisations for over a couple of days. the heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period is 179 mm (7 in) recorded on 1 october 1997. in 2022, bangalore faced a large amount of rainfall, which was 368% more than the yearly average. several areas were flooded, and power supply was also cut off.
