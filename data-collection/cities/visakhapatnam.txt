visakhapatnam's history dates back to the 6th century bce, when it was considered part of the kalinga kingdom, and later ruled by the vengi, the pallava and eastern ganga dynasties. visakhapatnam was an ancient port city which had trade relations with the middle east and rome. ships were anchored at open roads and were loaded with cargo transported from visakhapatnam shore by means of small masula boats. a reference to vizagapatam merchant is available in the inscriptions of sri bheemeswara swamy temple (1068 ad), east godavari district, andhra pradesh. during 12th century ad, vizagapatam was a fortified merchandize town managed by a guild. the city's control was alternating between the chola dynasty and the gajapati kingdom in 11th and 12th centuries, until its conquest by the vijayanagara empire in the 15th century.
in the 16th century, after the decline of the vijayanagara empire and the gajapatis, the coastal region of north andhra, including visakhapatnam, was annexed by the jeypore kingdom and remained part of it until the arrival of the british in 1711. evidently, the maharaja of jeypore was commonly referred to as the maharaja of visakhapatnam until the dissolution of the princely state in 1947. european powers eventually established trade operations in the city, and by the end of the 18th century it had come under french colonial rule. control passed to the east india company in 1804 and it remained under british colonial rule until indian independence in 1947.
the city is home to some reputed central and state educational institutions of the state, including andhra university (au), andhra medical college (amc), indian institute of management (iim), indian institute of petroleum and energy (iipe), damodaram sanjivayya national law university (dsnlu), indian maritime university (imu), and the national institute of oceanography among others. visakhapatnam serves as the headquarters for the indian navy's eastern naval command. the city also serves as the zonal headquarters of south coast railway zone (scor). the city is also home to the oldest shipyard and the only natural harbour on the east coast of india. visakhapatnam port is the fifth-busiest cargo port in india. the city is a major tourist destination and is known for its beaches, ancient buddhist sites, and the natural environment of the surrounding eastern ghats. it is nicknamed as the "city of destiny" and the "jewel of the east coast". according to the swachh survekshan rankings of 2020, it is the ninth cleanest city in india among cities with a population of more than 1 million.  in 2020, it was a finalist in the living and inclusion category of the world smart city awards.
