early history
kanheri caves contain buddhist sculptures and paintings dating from the 1st century ce to the 10th century ce.
mumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of seven islands: isle of bombay, parel, mazagaon, mahim, colaba, worli, and old woman's island (also known as little colaba). it is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited. pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around kandivali in northern mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the south asian stone age. perhaps at the beginning of the common era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the koli fishing community.
in the 3rd century bce, the islands formed part of the maurya empire, during its expansion in the south, ruled by the buddhist emperor ashoka of magadha. the kanheri caves in borivali were excavated from basalt rock in the first century ce, and served as an important centre of buddhism in western india during ancient times. the city then was known as heptanesia (ancient greek: a cluster of seven islands) to the greek geographer ptolemy in 150 ce. the mahakali caves in andheri were cut out between the 1st century bce and the 6th century ce.
between the 2nd century bce and 9th century ce, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: satavahanas, western satraps, abhira, vakataka, kalachuris, konkan mauryas, chalukyas and rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the shilaharas from 810 to 1260. some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are the jogeshwari caves (between 520 and 525), elephanta caves (between the sixth to seventh century), walkeshwar temple (10th century), and banganga tank (12th century).
the haji ali dargah was built in 1431, when mumbai was under the rule of the gujarat sultanate.
king bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in mahikawati (present day mahim). the pathare prabhus, among the earliest known settlers of the city, were brought to mahikawati from saurashtra in gujarat around 1298 by bhimdev. the delhi sultanate annexed the islands in 1347–48 and controlled it until 1407. during this time, the islands were administered by the muslim governors of gujarat, who were appointed by the delhi sultanate.
the islands were later governed by the independent gujarat sultanate, which was established in 1407. the sultanate's patronage led to the construction of many mosques, prominent being the haji ali dargah in worli, built in honour of the muslim saint haji ali in 1431. from 1429 to 1431, the islands were a source of contention between the gujarat sultanate and the bahmani sultanate of deccan. in 1493, bahadur khan gilani of the bahmani sultanate attempted to conquer the islands but was defeated.
portuguese and british rule

the madh fort built by the portuguese, was one of the most important forts in salsette.
the mughal empire, founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century. growing apprehensive of the power of the mughal emperor humayun, sultan bahadur shah of gujarat was obliged to sign the treaty of bassein with the portuguese empire on 23 december 1534. according to the treaty, the seven islands of bombay, the nearby strategic town of bassein and its dependencies were offered to the portuguese. the territories were later surrendered on 25 october 1535.
the portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their roman catholic religious orders in bombay. they called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form bombaim. the islands were leased to several portuguese officers during their regime. the portuguese franciscans and jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the st. michael's church at mahim (1534), st. john the baptist church at andheri (1579), st. andrew's church at bandra (1580), and gloria church at byculla (1632). the portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the bombay castle, castella de aguada (castelo da aguada or bandra fort), and madh fort. the english were in constant struggle with the portuguese vying for hegemony over bombay, as they recognised its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land attacks. by the middle of the 17th century the growing power of the dutch empire forced the english to acquire a station in western india. on 11 may 1661, the marriage treaty of charles ii of england and catherine of braganza, daughter of king john iv of portugal, placed the islands in possession of the english empire, as part of catherine's dowry to charles. however, salsette, bassein, mazagaon, parel, worli, sion, dharavi, and wadala still remained under portuguese possession. from 1665 to 1666, the english managed to acquire mahim, sion, dharavi, and wadala.

in accordance with the royal charter of 27 march 1668, england leased these islands to the english east india company in 1668 for a sum of £10 per annum. the population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675. the islands were subsequently attacked by yakut khan, the muslim koli admiral of the mughal empire, in october 1672, rickloffe van goen, the governor-general of dutch india on 20 february 1673, and siddi admiral sambal on 10 october 1673.
in 1687, the english east india company transferred its headquarters from surat to bombay. the city eventually became the headquarters of the bombay presidency. following the transfer, bombay was placed at the head of all the company's establishments in india. towards the end of the 17th century, the islands again suffered incursions from yakut khan in 1689–90. the portuguese presence ended in bombay when the marathas under peshwa baji rao i captured salsette in 1737, and bassein in 1739. by the middle of the 18th century, bombay began to grow into a major trading town, and received a huge influx of migrants from across india. later, the british occupied salsette on 28 december 1774. with the treaty of surat (1775), the british formally gained control of salsette and bassein, resulting in the first anglo-maratha war. the british were able to secure salsette from the marathas without violence through the treaty of purandar (1776), and later through the treaty of salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the first anglo-maratha war.

from 1782 onwards, the city was reshaped with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the seven islands of bombay into a single amalgamated mass by way of a causeway called the hornby vellard, which was completed by 1784. in 1817, the british east india company under mountstuart elphinstone defeated baji rao ii, the last of the maratha peshwa in the battle of khadki. following his defeat, almost the whole of the deccan plateau came under british suzerainty, and was incorporated into the bombay presidency. the success of the british campaign in the deccan marked the end of all attacks by native powers.
by 1845, the seven islands coalesced into a single landmass by the hornby vellard project via large scale land reclamation. on 16 april 1853, india's first passenger railway line was established, connecting bombay to the neighbouring town of thana (now thane). during the american civil war (1861–1865), the city became the world's chief cotton-trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy that subsequently enhanced the city's stature.
the opening of the suez canal in 1869 transformed bombay into one of the largest seaports on the arabian sea. in september 1896, bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. about 850,000 people fled bombay and the textile industry was adversely affected. while the city was the capital of the bombay presidency, the indian independence movement fostered the quit india movement in 1942 and the royal indian navy mutiny in 1946.

after india's independence in 1947, the territory of the bombay presidency retained by india was restructured into bombay state. the area of bombay state increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the indian union were integrated into the state. subsequently, the city became the capital of bombay state. in april 1950, municipal limits of bombay were expanded by merging the bombay suburban district and bombay city to form the greater bombay municipal corporation.
the samyukta maharashtra movement to create a separate maharashtra state including bombay was at its height in the 1950s. in the lok sabha discussions in 1955, the congress party demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. the states reorganisation committee recommended a bilingual state for maharashtra–gujarat with bombay as its capital in its 1955 report. bombay citizens' committee, an advocacy group of leading gujarati industrialists lobbied for bombay's independent status.
following protests during the movement in which 105 people died in clashes with the police, bombay state was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 may 1960. gujarati-speaking areas of bombay state were partitioned into the state of gujarat. maharashtra state with bombay as its capital was formed with the merger of marathi-speaking areas of bombay state, eight districts from central provinces and berar, five districts from hyderabad state, and numerous princely states enclosed between them. as a memorial to the martyrs of the samyukta maharashtra movement, flora fountain was renamed as hutatma chowk (martyr's square) and a memorial was erected.

the following decades saw massive expansion of the city and its suburbs. in the late 1960s, nariman point and cuffe parade were reclaimed and developed. the bombay metropolitan region development authority (bmrda) was established on 26 january 1975 by the government of maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the bombay metropolitan region. in august 1979, a sister township of new bombay was founded by the city and industrial development corporation (cidco) across the thane and raigad districts to help the dispersal and control of bombay's population. the textile industry in bombay largely disappeared after the widespread 1982 great bombay textile strike, in which nearly 250,000 workers in more than 50 textile mills went on strike. mumbai's defunct cotton mills have since become the focus of intense redevelopment. industrial development began in mumbai. when its economy started focusing on the fields of petrochemicals, electronics, electronics and automobile. in 1954 hindustan petroleum comissoned mumbai refinery at trombay and bpcl refinery.
the jawaharlal nehru port, which handles 55–60% of india's containerized cargo, was commissioned on 26 may 1989 across the creek at nhava sheva with a view to de-congest bombay harbour and to serve as a hub port for the city. the geographical limits of greater bombay were coextensive with municipal limits of greater bombay. on 1 october 1990, the greater bombay district was bifurcated to form two revenue districts namely, bombay city and bombay suburban, though they continued to be administered by same municipal administration.
the years from 1990 to 2010 saw an increase in violence and terrorism activities. following the demolition of the babri masjid in ayodhya, the city was rocked by the hindu-muslim riots of 1992–93 in which more than 1,000 people were killed. in march 1993, a series of 13 coordinated bombings at several city landmarks by islamic extremists and the bombay underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries. in 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains. in 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels. the three coordinated bomb explosions in july 2011 that occurred at the opera house, zaveri bazaar and dadar were the latest in the series of terrorist attacks in mumbai which resulted in 26 deaths and 130 injuries.
mumbai is the commercial capital of india and has evolved into a global financial hub. for several decades it has been the home of india's main financial services companies, and a focus for both infrastructure development and private investment. from being an ancient fishing community and a colonial centre of trade, mumbai has become south asia's largest city and home of the world's most prolific film industry.
