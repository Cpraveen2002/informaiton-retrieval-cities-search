the municipal corporation covers an area of 175 km (68 sq mi) and is divided into 55 administrative wards, each represented by an elected councilor.
at the time of the creation of the state of jharkhand in 2000, the bihar municipal act, 1922 was adapted as the jharkhand municipal act, 2000 to govern all ulbs in the new state. ranchi municipal corporation was governed by its own municipal act, the ranchi municipal corporation act, 2001. with the enactment of the jharkhand municipal act 2011, these two ceased to be in effect and the 2011 became the only governing legislature for all city governments in jharkhand.
under section 26 of the jharkhand municipal act, 2011, the positions of mayor and deputy mayor are elected directly i.e. the position holders are voted in by the people themselves. the last municipal election was in 2018 with a voter turnout of 49.3%, up from 38% in the last election in 2013. asha lakra and sanjiv vijayawargia – both from the bharatiya janta party – won the mayoral and deputy mayoral seats. the 2018 municipal election was the first time the mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates in jharkhand could use political party symbols, while the candidates for councilor seats continued to use symbols allotted to them by the jharkhand state election commission. the next municipal election will take place in 2023.
the jharkhand municipal act, 2011 mandates the establishment of ward committees for each ward in the municipality. though ward committees have been formed in ranchi, they are not active.
