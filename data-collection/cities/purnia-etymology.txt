several possible origins for the name purnia have been proposed. the name may originate from the sanskrit word purnaâ€“aranya, which means "complete jungle". purnia could also be an altered form of the old name purania, derived from the word purain or lotus, which is said to have grown on the kosi and mahananda rivers.
the city's name is also romanized as purnea.
