company garden[edit]
the saharanpur botanical gardens, known as the company garden and once the preserve of british east india company, is one of the oldest existing gardens in india, dating to before 1750. then named farahat-bakhsh, it was originally a pleasure ground set out by a local chief, intazam ud-ullah. in 1817, it was acquired by the british east india company and placed under the authority of the district surgeon. joseph dalton hooker says of this botanical garden that "amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from china, a fact i allude to, as many of my english readers may not be aware that the establishment of the tea-trade in the himalaya and assam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of calcutta and seharunpore."
in 1887, when the botanical survey of india was set up to reform the country's botanical sciences, saharanpur became the centre for the survey of the northern indian flora. the garden is seen historically as being second only to the calcutta gardens for its contribution to science and economy in india. under private auspices today, it is full of greenery and has many different kinds of plants and flowers.
