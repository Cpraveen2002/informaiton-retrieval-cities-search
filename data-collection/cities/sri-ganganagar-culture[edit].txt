culture[edit]
rural kutcha homes with folk art can be seen in some remote villages, but this art is losing ground.
a majority of people in the district speak bagri and punjabi. writers of the district have made contributions to rajasthani literature, through bagri.
bagri culture dominates the district, while punjabi culture has influence in some areas.
such scenes are common in some southern villages.
the embroidered odhni (mostly red) is a symbol of bagri women. kurto (a long shirt), ghaghro/ghagariyo (long frock-type clothes), borlo/boryo (a head ornament), and odhni/odhaniyo are the traditional dress of bagri women, though the younger generation has adopted salwar kameez or western clothing.
the purdah (or veil) is mainly in vogue among bagri women. men mainly wear a pant-shirt, kurta-payjama and dhoti.
traditional and pop punjabi music and rajasthani devotional music is popular. bollywood songs are listened to with the same enthusiasm as in other northern indian regions.
