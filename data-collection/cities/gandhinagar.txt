gandhinagar (/ɡɑːndɪˈnɑːɡər/, gujarati: [ˈgɑːndʱinəgəɾ] (listen)) is the capital of the state of gujarat in india. gandhinagar is located approximately 23 km north of ahmedabad, on the west central point of the industrial corridor between delhi, the political capital of india, and mumbai, the financial capital of india.
gandhinagar lies on the west bank of the sabarmati river, about 545 km (338 miles) north of mumbai and 901 km (560 miles) southwest of delhi.  the akshardham temple is located in gandhinagar. there was a determination to make gandhinagar a purely indian enterprise, partly because the state of gujarat was the birthplace of mahatma gandhi. for this reason, the planning was done by two indian town planners: prakash m apte and h. k. mewada, who had apprenticed with le corbusier in chandigarh.
