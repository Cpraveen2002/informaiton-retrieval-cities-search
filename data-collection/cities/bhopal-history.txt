early history
bhopal was founded by and named after 11th-century malwa king bhoja
according to folklore, bhopal was founded in the 11th century by the paramara king bhoja, who ruled from his capital at dhar. this theory states that bhopal was originally known as bhojpal after a dam (pal) constructed by the king's minister. an alternative theory says that the city is named after another king called bhupala (or bhupal). according to yet another version, raja bhoj suffered from leprosy. his physician advised him to build a lake with water from 365 rivers and take daily bath in it. when such a lake was built, it was called bhoj tal [or bhoj’s lake]. gradually people started calling the city bhojpal, and finally bhopal.
mausoleum of dost khan founder of bhopal state
in the early 17th century, bhopal was a small village in the gond kingdom. the modern bhopal city was established by dost mohammad khan (1660-1726) died at the age of 66, a pashtun soldier in the mughal army. after the death of the emperor aurangzeb, khan started providing mercenary services to local chieftains in the politically unstable malwa region. in 1709, he took on the lease of berasia estate and later annexed several territories in the region to establish the bhopal state. khan received the territory of bhopal from the gond queen kamlapati in lieu of payment for mercenary services and usurped her kingdom after her death. in the 1720s, he built the fatehgarh fort in the village, which developed into the city of bhopal over the next few decades.
begum rule
bhopal became a princely state after signing a treaty (during the reign of nazar mohammed khan 1816–1819)  with the british east india company in 1818. between 1819 and 1926, the state was ruled by four women, begums – unique in the royalty of those days – under british suzerainty. qudsia begum was the first woman ruler (between 1819 and 1837), who was succeeded by her granddaughter, shah jehan. between the years 1844–1860, when shah jehan was a child, her mother sikandar (only daughter of qudsia) ruled as regent. curiously during the 1857 revolt, sikandar supported the british, for which she was rewarded by proclaiming her as king in 1858. to give her further honor, she was given a 19-gun salute and the grand cross of the star of india. the latter made her equivalent to a british person, who had been granted a knighthood. thus she became, at that time, the only female knight in the entire british empire besides queen victoria. among the relatively minor rewards, a territory was restored to her, that she had earlier lost to a neighbouring prince.
sikandar ruled until 1868, when shah jehan succeeded her and was begum until 1901. in 1901, shah jehan's daughter kaikhusrau jahan became begum, ruled until 1926, and was the last of the female line of succession. in 1926, she abdicated in favour of her son, hamidullah khan, who ruled until 1947, and was the last of the sovereign nawabs. the rule of begums gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system, and a municipality constituted in 1907.
post independence
bhopal state was the second-largest muslim-ruled princely state: the first being hyderabad. after the independence of india in 1947, the last nawab expressed his wish to retain bhopal as a separate unit. agitations against the nawab broke out in december 1948, leading to the arrest of prominent leaders including shankar dayal sharma. later, the political detainees were released, and the nawab signed the agreement for bhopal's merger with the union of india on 30 april 1949. the bhopal state was taken over by the union government of india on 1 june 1949.
bhopal gas tragedy

main article: bhopal disaster
in early december 1984, a union carbide pesticide plant in bhopal leaked around 32 tons of toxic gases, including methyl isocyanate (mic) gas which led to the worst industrial disaster in the world to date.
the official death toll was initially recorded as around 4,000. a madhya pradesh government report stated 3,787 deaths, while other estimates state the fatalities were significantly higher (16,000) from the accident and the medical complications caused by the accident in the weeks and years that followed. the higher estimates have been challenged by union carbide, however, medical staff in the city were not able to adequately record data due to the massive influx of patients. the impact of the disaster continues to this day in terms of psychological and neurological disabilities, blindness, skin, vision, breathing, and birth disorders.
the soil and ground water near the factory site have been contaminated by the toxic wastes. the bhopal disaster continues to be the part of the socio-political debate; the clean-up of environmental contamination and rehabilitation of those affected continues to challenge the people of bhopal.
the centre is seeking a direction to union carbide and other firms for ₹ 78.44 billion additional amount over and above the earlier settlement amount of us$470 million in 1989 for paying compensation to the gas tragedy victims.
