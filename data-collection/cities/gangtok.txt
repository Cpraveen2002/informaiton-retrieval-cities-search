gangtok is a city, municipality, the capital and the largest populated place of the indian state of sikkim. it is also the headquarters of the gangtok district. gangtok is in the eastern himalayan range, at an elevation of 1,650 m (5,410 ft). the city's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities of sikkimese people such as indian gorkhas, bhutia and lepchas. within the higher peaks of the himalayas and with a year-round mild temperate climate, gangtok is at the centre of sikkim's tourism industry.
gangtok rose to prominence as a popular buddhist pilgrimage site after the construction of the enchey monastery in 1840. in 1894, the ruling sikkimese chogyal, thutob namgyal, transferred the capital to gangtok. in the early 20th century, gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between lhasa in tibet and cities such as kolkata (then calcutta) in british india. after india won its independence from the british empire in 1947, sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with gangtok as its capital. after sikkim's merger with india in 1975, gangtok continued as the state capital.
