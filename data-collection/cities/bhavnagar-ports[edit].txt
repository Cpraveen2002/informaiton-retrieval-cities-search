ports[edit]
bhavnagar had trade links with southeast asia, africa, arabia and ports of red sea since the early 18th century. the old port bhavnagar harbar was built by the state of bhavnagar, and hosted a light beacon since 1860. this port was later modernised in 1930 under the supervision of j. johnston, then port officer of bhavnagar state. wharfs, warehouses, and railway transportation were added. a new port, 8 kilometres (5.0Â mi) south of the old port, was built and made operational in the 1950s due to heavy silting at the location of the old port. this port also had a lighthouse, which was damaged in the 2001 earthquake.
bhavnagar lockgate, built in 1963 and the first of its kind in india when built, is one of the oldest port in the state, and is very useful to keep ships afloat during low tide.
