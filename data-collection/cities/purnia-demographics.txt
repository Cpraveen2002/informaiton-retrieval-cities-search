agriculture
purnia is supplied with agricultural products by its surrounding countryside. the alluvial soil, irrigated by the kosi and mahananda rivers, has been particularly suited to the paddy cultivation of rice. other crops grown are potatoes, wheat, khesari, chickpeas, chili peppers, maize, lentils, arhar dal, barley, sugarcane, tobacco, makhana, mung beans, and jute. the previous extensive growing of jute supported a former flourishing jute industry which has now declined. the cultivation of maize has however soared in recent years in the city's outskirts.
