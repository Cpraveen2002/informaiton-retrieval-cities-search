gupta inscriptions name indore as 'indrapura'. it is believed that the city is named after its indreshwar mahadev temple, where indra is the presiding deity. it is believed that indra himself did tapasya (meditation) in this place and led sage swami indrapuri to establish the temple. later, tukoji rao holkar who belonged to the holkar clan of the marathas and was the feudatory of indore, renovated the temple.
