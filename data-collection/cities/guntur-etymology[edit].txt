Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the earliest reference to the present name of the city can be dated back to the period of ammaraja–i (922-929 ce), the vengi eastern chalukyan king. it also has its appearance in another two inscriptions dated 1147 ad and 1158 ad. in sanskrit, guntur was referred to as garthapuri. "garthapuri" or "guntlapuri" translates to "a place surrounded by water ponds". the settlement might have been near a pond, a "gunta" in telugu; hence, :gunta uru" translates to "pond village" in telugu. another source refers to "kunta" (a land measuring unit) which may have transformed to "kunta uru" and later to "guntur".
