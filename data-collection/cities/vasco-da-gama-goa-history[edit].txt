this city, in the former portuguese territory of goa, is named after the famous portuguese explorer and navigator vasco da gama, who held the title of governor of portuguese india. this city serves as the headquarters of the mormugao sub-district. it was founded in 1543 and remained in portuguese hands until 1961, when the territory was lost to india.
vasco da gama, 1st count of vidigueira was the first european to reach india by sea. his initial voyage to india (1497â€“1499) was the first to link europe and asia by an ocean route, connecting the atlantic and the indian oceans and, in this way, the west and the east. he reached goa on 11 september 1524 but died at kochi three months later. his remains were eventually returned to portugal and interred at st jeronimos monastery.
the city is sometimes referred to as sambhaji nagar. sambhaji was the eldest son of shivaji, the founder of the maratha empire. an attempt was made to change the city's name to sambhaji nagar, and this is reflected in a few government records. however, no official records have been found as to when the city was renamed. it is thus dismissed as a political move.
