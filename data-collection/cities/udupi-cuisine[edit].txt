masala dosa is a part of udupi cuisine.
the term udupi (also udipi) is synonymous with vegetarian food now found all over the world. the origin of this cuisine is linked to krishna matha (mutt). lord krishna is offered food of different varieties every day, and there are certain restrictions on ingredients during chaturmasa (a four-month period during the monsoon season). these restrictions coupled with the requirement of variety led to innovation, especially in dishes incorporating seasonal and locally available materials. this cuisine was developed by shivalli madhwa brahmins who cooked food for lord krishna, and at krishna matha in udupi, the food is provided free of cost. restaurants specialised in udupi cuisine can be seen widely in most metropolitan and large cities around the length and breadth of india.
although popular for its vegetarian cuisine, udupi has its fair share of non-vegetarian dishes that are similar to mangalorean cuisine. some of these include kori roti, neer dosa, kori pulimunchi, chicken sukka, fish curry, fish fry and more.
