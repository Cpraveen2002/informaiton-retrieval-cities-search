etymology[edit]
jind was named jayantapura after the lord of victory jayant (indra), whom pandavas worshipped before the mahabharata war. according to oral tradition, pandavas built the jayanti devi temple in honour of jainti devi (the goddess of victory, a feminine representation of indra). they offered prayers for success and then started a battle against kaurava. the town was built around the temple and named jaintapuri (abode of jainti devi) which was later renamed to jind.
