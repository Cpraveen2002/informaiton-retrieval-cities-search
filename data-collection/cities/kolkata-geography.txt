spread roughly north–south along the east bank of the hooghly river, kolkata sits within the lower ganges delta of eastern india approximately 75 km (47 mi) west of the international border with bangladesh; the city's elevation is 1.5–9 m (5–30 ft). much of the city was originally a wetland that was reclaimed over the decades to accommodate a burgeoning population. the remaining undeveloped areas, known as the east kolkata wetlands, were designated a "wetland of international importance" by the ramsar convention (1975). as with most of the indo-gangetic plain, the soil and water are predominantly alluvial in origin. kolkata is located over the "bengal basin", a pericratonic tertiary basin. bengal basin comprises three structural units: shelf or platform in the west; central hinge or shelf/slope break; and deep basinal part in the east and southeast. kolkata is located atop the western part of the hinge zone which is about 25 km (16 mi) wide at a depth of about 45,000 m (148,000 ft) below the surface. the shelf and hinge zones have many faults, among them some are active. total thickness of sediment below kolkata is nearly 7,500 m (24,600 ft) above the crystalline basement; of these the top 350–450 m (1,150–1,480 ft) is quaternary, followed by 4,500–5,500 m (14,760–18,040 ft) of tertiary sediments, 500–700 m (1,640–2,300 ft) trap wash of cretaceous trap and 600–800 m (1,970–2,620 ft) permian-carboniferous gondwana rocks. the quaternary sediments consist of clay, silt and several grades of sand and gravel. these sediments are sandwiched between two clay beds: the lower one at a depth of 250–650 m (820–2,130 ft); the upper one 10–40 m (30–130 ft) in thickness. according to the bureau of indian standards, on a scale ranging from i to v in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes, the city lies inside seismic zone iii.

the kolkata metropolitan area is spread over 1,886.67 km (728.45 sq mi) and comprises 4 municipal corporations (including kolkata municipal corporation), 37 local municipalities and 24 panchayat samitis, as of 2011. the urban agglomeration encompassed 72 cities and 527 towns and villages, as of 2006. suburban areas in the kolkata metropolitan area incorporate parts of the following districts: north 24 parganas, south 24 parganas, howrah, hooghly and nadia. kolkata, which is under the jurisdiction of the kolkata municipal corporation (kmc), has an area of 206.08 km (80 sq mi). the east–west dimension of the city is comparatively narrow, stretching from the hooghly river in the west to roughly the eastern metropolitan bypass in the east—a span of 9–10 km (5.6–6.2 mi). the north–south distance is greater, and its axis is used to section the city into north, central, south and east kolkata. north kolkata is the oldest part of the city. characterised by 19th-century architecture and narrow alleyways, it includes areas such as jorasanko, rajabazar, maniktala, ultadanga, shyambazar, shobhabazar, bagbazar, cossipore, sinthee etc. the north suburban areas like dum dum, baranagar, belgharia, sodepur, khardaha, new barrackpore, madhyamgram, barrackpore, barasat etc. are also within the city of kolkata (as a metropolitan structure). central kolkata hosts the central business district. it contains b. b. d. bagh, formerly known as dalhousie square, and the esplanade on its east; rajiv gandhi sarani is on its west. the west bengal secretariat, general post office, reserve bank of india, calcutta high court, lalbazar police headquarters and several other government and private offices are located there. another business hub is the area south of park street, which comprises thoroughfares such as jawahar lal nehru road, abanindra nath tagore sarani, dr. martin luther king sarani, dr. upendra nath brahmachari sarani, shakespeare sarani and acharay jagadish chandra basu road. south kolkata developed after india gained independence in 1947; it includes upscale neighbourhoods such as bhawanipore, alipore, ballygunge, kasba, dhakuria, santoshpur, garia, golf green, tollygunge, new alipore, behala, barisha etc. the south suburban areas like maheshtala, budge budge, rajpur sonarpur, baruipur etc. are also within the city of kolkata (as a metropolitan structure). the maidan is a large open field in the heart of the city that has been called the "lungs of kolkata" and accommodates sporting events and public meetings. the victoria memorial and kolkata race course are located at the southern end of the maidan. among the other parks are central park in bidhannagar and millennium park on rajiv gandhi sarani, along the hooghly river.
two planned townships in the greater kolkata region are bidhannagar, also known as salt lake city and located north-east of the city; and rajarhat, also called new town and located east of bidhannagar. in the 2000s, sector 5 in bidhannagar developed into a business hub for information technology and telecommunication companies. both bidhannagar and new town are situated outside the kolkata municipal corporation limits, in their own municipalities.
