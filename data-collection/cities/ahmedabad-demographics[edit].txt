poverty[edit]
in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the textile mills that were responsible for much of ahmedabad's wealth faced competition from automation and domestic specialty looms. several mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city centre. the ahmedabad municipal corporation (amc), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. in the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.
ahmedabad has made efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. the urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993–1994 to 10% in 2011–2012. this is partly due to the strengthening of the amc and its partnership with several civil society organizations (csos) representing poor residents. through projects and programs, the amc has provided utilities and basic services to slums. however, some challenges remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. this has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.
informal housing and slums[edit]
as of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. the other 34% lives in slums or chawls, which are tenements for industrial workers. there are approximately 700 slum settlements in ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. the population of ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained generally constant, and this has led to a rise in density of both formal and informal housing and a more economical usage of existing space. the indian census estimates that the ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and had decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. there is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population that lives in slum settlements, and that there has also been a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.
slum networking project[edit]
in the 1990s, the amc faced increased slum populations. they found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues, they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. to address this, beginning in 1995, the amc partnered with civil society organizations to create the slum networking project (snp) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households. this project, also known as parivartan (change), involved participatory planning in which slum residents were partners alongside amc, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local ngos. the goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training). in addition, participating households were granted a minimum de facto tenure of ten years. the project cost a total of ₹4,350 million. community members and the private sector each contributed ₹600 million, ngos provided ₹90 million, and the amc paid for the rest of the project. each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.
this project has generally been regarded as a success. having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most work out of their homes. it also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance. the snp received the 2006 unhabitat dubai international award for best practice to improve the living environment. however, concerns remain about the community's responsibility and capacity for the maintenance of the new infrastructure. additionally, trust was weakened when the amc demolished two of slums that were upgraded as part of snp to create recreational parks.
