economic growth is led by the manufacturing sector. bhayandar is divided into two parts by the mumbai suburban rail line - east and west. mira road has seen development only in the east part, while the west part, on the other side of the railway line is covered with salt pans and mangroves. mira road east is a predominantly residential area. its calm, quiet surroundings and low pollution make it a desirable residential oasis.
bhayandar west was traditionally residential, and the east predominantly an industrial area in the field of steel utensils manufacturing. recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between bhayandar and neighboring mira road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. government-owned salt pans and marshland in west mira road have restricted the southward spread of bhayandar. there is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a large industrial complex.
