toponymy[edit]
there are many legends behind the origin of the name vijayawada. it is said that goddess durga killed mahishasura and relaxed at this place. as she was victorious, the place came to be known as vijayawada (vijaya translates to victory and wada as place, literally meaning the place of victory). the hill was called as indrekeeladri since it was frequently visited by indra and his affiliates. the epic mahabharata refers to the indrakiladri hills as the place where arjuna secured pashupatastra from lord shiva. one of the names of arjuna is "vijaya" (invincible). thus city thereafter came to be known as vijayavatika ('vatika' translates to place in telugu) and later as vijayawada.
in some legends, vijayawada was referred to as rajendracholapura as virarajendra chola won a battle against chalukyas in 1068 and ruled over this place. a tale behind its acquiring the name bezawada is that goddess krishnaveni (river krishna) requested arjuna to make a passage for her to merge into the bay of bengal. hence, arjuna made a bejjam (hole) through the mountains and the place came to be known as bejjamwada which later changed to bezawada. other names of vijayawada were being vijayavata, beejapuram, kanakaprabha, kanakapuram, kanakawada, jayapuri, vijayapuri, phalguna kshetram and jananathpura in the twelfth century ce.
