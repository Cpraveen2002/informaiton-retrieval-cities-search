civic administration[edit]
karimnagar municipal corporation is the civic body that administers the city. it was constituted as a third grade municipality in the year 1952, as a second grade in 1959, first grade in 1984, special grade in 1996, selection grade in 1999 and finally upgraded to corporation in 2005.
despite of city growing in leaps and bounds, the area of the civic body remaining unaltered. ever since the municipality was upgraded into corporation in 2005, the merger of adjoining villages on the outskirts with the corporation was being met with wide opposition from local village authorities.
