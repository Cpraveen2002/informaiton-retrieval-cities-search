Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the earliest reference to pune (marathi: पुणे) is an inscription on a rashtrakuta dynasty copper plate dated 937 ce, which refers to the town as punya-vishaya. by the 13th century, it had come to be known as punawadi.
during the rashtrakuta dynasty, the city was referred to as punnaka and punyapur, while the copper plates of 758 and 768 ce show that the yadava dynasty had renamed the city punakavishaya and punya vishaya. 'vishaya' means land, and 'punaka' and 'punya' mean holy. the city was known as kasbe pune when under the command of maratha king shivaji's father, shahaji raje bhosale. mughal emperor aurangzeb renamed the city muhiyabad (the only divergent naming) some time between 1703 and 1705 in memory of his great-grandson muhi-ul-milan, who died there. the name muhiyabad was lost soon after aurangzeb's death. anglicized to poona in 1857 by the english during british rule, the city's name was changed to pune in 1978.
