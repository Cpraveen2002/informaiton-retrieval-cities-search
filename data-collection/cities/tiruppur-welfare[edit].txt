environmental issues
tiruppur, like any other industrial town, faces its share of environmental pollution complaints. as per the directive of madras high court, zero liquid discharge (zld) should be strictly followed in tiruppur knitwear cluster during the effluent treatment process. failure to implement this order, led to a court ordered closure of all dyeing units and bleaching units. in turn, tirupur exporters association made a representation to the government that export revenues of â‚¹ 11 billion were lost and about 100,000 labourers lost their job due to a closure of dyeing units in tirupur.
as per a report by crisil, prepared in february 2011, ensuring zero liquid discharge (zld), will primarily affect the operational costs of dyeing and bleaching units, increasing it by 7% to 10%. eventually, by complying with the above order, tiruppur became the first textile cluster in india to achieve zero liquid discharge in their units. both the common effluent treatment plant and individual effluent treatment plant are in place to treat effluents. farmers in tiruppur and its hinterland, who have faced the brunt of the indiscriminate discharge of industrial effluents into the water bodies for the past many decades, are yet again becoming concerned. untreated effluents, mostly containing dyes and chemicals in high concentration, are now seen let off clandestinely once again in large quantities through storm water drains into water bodies or into open areas with the discharge mostly happening during the early morning hours or during rain.
