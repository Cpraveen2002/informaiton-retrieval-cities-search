tourism to nearby sites like nalanda, rajgir and pawapuri also boosts the city's economy, as do footwear and garments manufactured by household industries. the locality of sohsarai in the city hosts an extensive textile market, which is known as "mini surat".
as of 1981, the city had a major beedi cigarette industry which employed 15,000 people, mainly muslims and some lower-caste hindus.
in recent years the city has changed from a trade-based economy to an education hub.
