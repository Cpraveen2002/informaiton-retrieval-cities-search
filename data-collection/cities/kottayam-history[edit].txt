kottayam has played its role in all the political agitations of modern times. the ‘malayali memorial ‘ agitation may be said to have had its origin in kottayam. the malayali memorial sought to secure better representation for educated travancoreans in the travancore civil service against persons from outside. the memorial, which was presented to the maharaja sri moolam thirunal (1891) was drafted at a public meeting held in the kottayam public library. the event marked the beginning of the modern political movement in the state.
it was here that the famous vaikom satyagraha (1924–25), an epic struggle for eradication of untouchability, took place. scheduled castes and other backward classes in travancore were denied not only entry into temples, but also access to temple roads. vaikom, the seat of a celebrated siva temple, was the venue of the symbolic satyagraha. due to these protests, the maharaja chithira thirunal balarama varma issued the temple entry proclamation in 1936.
indian rule (1949–present)[edit]
kottayam became a revenue division of travancore. a fifth division, devikulam, existed for a short period but was later added to kottayam. at the time of the integration of the state of travancore and cochin in 1949, these revenue divisions were redesignated as districts and the diwan peshkars gave way to district collectors, with the kottayam district established in july 1949.
