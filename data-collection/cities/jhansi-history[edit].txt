during ancient times, jhansi was a stronghold of the chandela rajput kings and was known as balwant nagar. however, it lost importance in the 11th century after the decline of the chandela dynasty. it rose in prominence in the 17th century when a rajput raja bir singh deo of orchha state constructed the jhansi fort in 1613.
jhansi came under the maratha empire in 1729 when maharaja chattrasal offered jhansi and some other parts of his state to the maratha peshwa baji rao i as a mark of gratitude for having helped him in defeating the nawaf of farrukhabad muhammad khan bangash who had attacked maharaja chattrasal's kingdom.
in the 18th century, the town of jhansi served as the capital of a maratha province and later the princely state of jhansi from 1804 till 1858, when the territory became a part of british india.
after the independence of india, jhansi was included in the state of uttar pradesh
