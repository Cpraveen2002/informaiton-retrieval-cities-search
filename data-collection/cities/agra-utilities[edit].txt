the electricity power distribution and bill collection in agra is the sole responsibility of torrent power, a private sector company. the control of power distribution in agra was handed over to torrent power from the state-owned up power corporation ltd in 2010, in an effort to move towards power reforms and cutting the massive distribution losses in the state. this was the first time power distribution was privatised in uttar pradesh, except for noida-greater noida falling under the ncr.
agra has three primary sources for municipal water supply: water treatment plants at sikandra and jeoni mandi, and groundwater using tubewells. since a large portion of the water demand is fulfilled from the yamuna river, which is a highly polluted river, water quality in agra is usually poor, with unhealthy levels of chlorine required for purification. the city's groundwater is also unfit for drinking, and is saline and high in fluoride content. both sources breach cpcb standards. to provide the city with adequate water supply, the gangajal pipeline project has been initiated. it includes a 130Â km long pipeline laid to bring ganga water from bulandshahr's upper ganga canal to agra. the project has been launched, but has faced criticism due to frequent pipeline leakages.
though most of the city uses cylinders for cooking gas, piped natural gas is also available in select localities, including kamla nagar and others. the service is provided by green gas limited.
