main bathing ghat, at haridwar, in the 1880s.
for centuries when hindu ancestors visited the holy town of haridwar for any purpose which may have been for pilgrimage purposes or/and for cremation of their dead or for immersion of ashes and bones of their kin after cremation into the waters of the holy ganges as required by hindu religious custom, it has been a custom to go to the pandit who is in charge of one's family register and update the family's family tree with details of marriages, births, and deaths from ones extended joint family.
