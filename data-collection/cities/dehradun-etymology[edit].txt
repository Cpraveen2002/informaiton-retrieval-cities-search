etymology[edit]
dehradun is made up of two words "dehra" + "dun." "dehra" is a hindi word with the meaning of temple, whose etymology is: "dev" + "ghar", from prakrit "devahara." "dūn" (or hindi दून derives from the sanskrit droṇī (or द्रोणि) and means "a tract of country lying at the foot of hills; a valley"
the town was established when baba ram rai, the son of the seventh sikh guru, guru har rai built a gurudwara or temple in the area in the 17th century. ram rai was sent by his father as an emissary to the mughal emperor aurangzeb in delhi. aurangzeb objected to a verse in the sikh scripture (asa ki var) that stated, "the clay from a musalman's grave is kneaded into potter's lump", considering it an insult to islam. baba ram rai explained that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting "musalman" with "beiman" (faithless, evil) which aurangzeb approved. the willingness to change a word led guru har rai to bar his son from his presence, and name his younger son as his successor. aurangzeb responded by granting baba ram rai a jagir (land grant) in garhwal region (uttarakhand). the town later came to be known as dehradun, after dehra referring to baba ram rai's shrine. many followers of ram rai, called ramraiyas, settled with ram rai, during the days of british raj, the official name of the town was dehra. in due time the word dehra was linked to dun, and thus the city was named dehradun.
in the skanda purana, dun is mentioned as a part of the region called kedarkhand, the abode of shiva. according to hindu mythology, in ancient india during the mahabharata epic era, dronacharya the great teacher of kauravas and pandavas, lived here hence the name, "dronanagari" (lit. city of drona).
