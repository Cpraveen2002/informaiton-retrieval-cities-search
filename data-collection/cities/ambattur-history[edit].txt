history[edit]
along with avadi, sembium, ennore and tiruvottriyur, ambattur is part of the "auto belt" in the city's industrial north and west regions that developed when the automobile industry developed in madras, in the early post-world war ii years. sir ivan stedeford, chairman of tube investments, united kingdom, was instrumental in starting the ti factory and tii complex in the country. sir ivan signed a joint venture agreement with a. m. murugappa chettiar of the murugappa group, which was then a small business house manufacturing sandpaper and abrasives for the war effort and also trading war surplus. it was the first joint venture agreement to be signed in south india after independence. this resulted in the establishment of the ti cycle factory in a mango grove in ambattur by 1951, and manufacture of the 'hercules india' bicycle soon began. by 1954, the word 'india' was dropped from the name when international quality standards were met.
in 1954, sir ivan signed his second joint venture, tube products india, with the murugappa family. the factory was established on what had been the british government of malaya's immigration camp. by 1956, production was started in the new factory and soon resulted in the establishment of other ti factories in the ambattur-avadi industrial stretch. this led to a rapid growth in population in the region and several public amenities were established in ambattur by ti company, such as the sir ramaswamy mudaliar higher secondary school (named after the person who had initially introduced the partners to each other), a post office and a bank. when the growing population demanded a hospital, the company established one between ambattur and avadi in 1966 from a gift of around Â£5,000 from sir ivan. the hospital was named the sir ivan stedeford hospital in his honour.
