history[edit]
the first historical mention of sipri (shivpuri) was of emperor akbar hunting elephants there in 1564.
in the 16th century, shivpuri, like all of gwalior, was part the maratha empire. the empire weakened at the end of the century, and during the gardi-ka-wakt, or 'period of unrest', the rajput of narwar secured the town and district. the sindhias, under daulat scindia, captured the town and district from the ruler of narwar in 1804, and made the town their summer capital.
