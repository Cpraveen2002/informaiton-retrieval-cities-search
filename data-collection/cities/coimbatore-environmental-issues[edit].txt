environmental issues[edit]
air pollution, lack of proper waste management infrastructure and degradation of water bodies are the major environmental issues in coimbatore. there is a sewage treatment plant at ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the noyyal river through streams. this along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. the tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. the corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the noyyal river. environment conservation group based out of the city is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.
