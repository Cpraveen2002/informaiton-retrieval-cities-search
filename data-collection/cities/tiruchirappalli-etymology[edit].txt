tiruchirappalli
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
historically, tiruchirappalli was commonly referred to in english as "trichinopoly". the shortened forms "trichy" or "tiruchi" are used in everyday speech and the full name tiruchirapalli appears in official use by government and quasi-government offices but seldom used by the general public.
according to the late scholar c. p. brown, tiruchirappalli might be a derivative of the word chiruta-palli (lit. "little town"). orientalists henry yule and arthur coke burnell have speculated that the name may derive from a rock inscription carved in the 16th century in which tiruchirappalli is written as tiru-ssila-palli, meaning "holy-rock-town" in tamil. other scholars have suggested that the name tiruchirappalli is a rewording of tiru-chinna-palli, meaning "holy little town". the madras glossary gives the root as tiruććināppalli or the "holy (tiru) village (palli) of the shina (cissampelos pareira) plant".
according to hindu mythology, tiruchirappalli derives its name from the three-headed demon trishira, who meditated on the hindu god shiva near the present-day city to obtain favours from the god. an alternative derivation, albeit not universally accepted, is that the source of the city's name is the sanskrit word "trishirapuram"—trishira, meaning "three-headed", and palli or puram meaning "city".
