the marathi language spoken in kolhapur has some distinctive adaptations. women for example will use the masculine gender for verbs. some syllables in names are uniquely shortened to utter them faster. for example, शंकर becomes शंक्रोबा. some phrases are unique to the local dialect, and especially popular among the youth, such as 'काय भावा?', 'नाद नाही करायचा', 'काटा कीर्रर्र', 'खटक्यावर बोट, and 'जाग्यावर पल्टी'.
