Indian Standard Time calculation[edit]
indian standard time calculation[edit]
indian standard time is calculated from the clock tower in mirzapur nearly exactly on the reference longitude of indian standard time at 82Â°30'e, within 4 angular minutes, a property shared by tuni, a town in andhra pradesh. this is because there is a time lag of two hours between gujarat and arunachal pradesh. hence, this was taken as the standard meridian for the whole country.
