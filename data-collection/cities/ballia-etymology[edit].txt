ballia
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
according to locals, the name ballia was derived from the name of the sage valmiki, the author of ramayana. valmiki resided here at one point, and the place was commemorated by a shrine (although it has long since been washed away). another belief about the origin of the name is that it refers to the sandy quality of the soil, locally known as "ballua" (balu meaning sand).
