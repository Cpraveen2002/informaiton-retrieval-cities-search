history[edit]
the city of firozpur was founded by firuz shah tughlaq , a ruler of the tughluq dynasty, who reigned over the sultanate of delhi from 1351 to 1388. it is located on the banks of the sutlej river on the indiaâ€“pakistan border. the nearby firozpur cantonment is a major cantonment of the country.
british rule was first established in 1835, when, on the failure of heirs to the sikh family who possessed it, a small escheat to the british government was formed, and the district was gradually formed around this nucleus. the strategic importance of ferozepur (as it was spelled under the british) was at this time very great, and in 1839 it was the outpost of british india in the direction of the sikh power. it accordingly became the scene of operations during the first anglo-sikh war, in which the sikhs crossed the sutlej in december 1845, but were defeated and withdrew into their own territory, and peace was concluded with the treaty of lahore. later, throughout the indian mutiny ferozepur remained in the hands of the english.
the saragarhi memorial gurudwara commemorates 21 sikh soldiers of the 36th sikh regiment who died in the battle of saragarhi, defending a signal post against an overwhelming enemy force on 12 september 1897.the 21 soldiers defended the saragarhi fort against the attack of 10000 invaders all the 21 soldiers were awarded indian order of merit .the 20 soldiers out of 21 were from ferozepur.
the barki memorial, built in 1969, is a memorial to the soldiers of the 7 infantry division who died in a battle in 1965 which led to india taking the town of barki, 15 miles south-east of lahore.
