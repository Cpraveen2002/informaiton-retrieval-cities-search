soon after the partition of india in 1947, a large group of sindhi hindus refugees from sindh of pakistan migrated to india. the maharaja of kutch his highness maharao shri vijayrajji khengarji jadeja, donated 15,000 acres (61Â km) of land to bhai pratap, who founded the sindhu resettlement corporation ltd (src) to rehabilitate sindhi hindus that migrated from sindh in pakistan.
the sindhu resettlement corporation ltd was formed with acharaya kriplani as chairman and bhai pratap dialdas as managing director. the main objective of the corporation was to assist in the rehousing of displaced persons by the construction of a new township. the original plan was prepared by a team of planners headed by dr. o. h. koenigsberger, director of the division of housing in the government of india. later, the plan was revised by adams howard and greeley company in 1952. the foundation stone of the town was laid with the blessings of gandhi in 1947. hence, the town was named gandhidham. to clean the desert where it was built, bhai pratap gave an incentive of 25 paise to kill scorpions and 50 paise to kill snakes. the original plan envisaged 400,000 as of the ultimate population of the town, expecting half of it to be reached in the mid-seventies. a revised plan envisaged three stages of town development with the mid-stage lasting longer with a population of around 150,000.
