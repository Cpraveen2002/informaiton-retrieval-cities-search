it handles mostly passenger traffic while cargo is handled at the nearby jagannathpur station.
by air[edit]
this city has an airstrip at rangeilunda. the airstrip was in much use during british raj. however, post independence, it has lied in a dilapidated condition with no scope of expansion due to its adjacence to berhampur university. demands for a new greenfield airport have been echoing throughout the years but have remained futile due to government inaction.
biju patnaik international airport is nearby commercial airport.

the gopalpur port was recommisioned after renovation and expansion. it is a private port and handles mineral exports and imports. no passenger ships, cruises or ferries operate to or from there as of 2021.
