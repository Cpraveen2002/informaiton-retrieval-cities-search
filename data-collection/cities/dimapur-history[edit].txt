history[edit]
situated on the banks of the dhansiri (originally known as dong-siri meaning a ravine of peaceful habitation), dimapur was described as the 'brick city' by the european scholars and by the ahoms.
medieval period[edit]
in the 13th century, the city was the capital of the dimasa kingdom, which was once a powerful and predominant state in the now north east india (brahmaputra/dilao valley). in the heart of the city there is an old relic of the dimasa kachari kingdom which speaks about the once prosperous era.
