this makes it the second largest city in paschim medinipur district after kharagpur.  the city has a hindus population of 139,827 and muslims population of 27,238. the multiple mosques and temples, many predating british rule serve as indication of how co-prevalent the two religions are in this area.  it is an important religious spot for the muslims of india and bangladesh.  even though the interesting religious mixture would suggest religious tensions, remarkably midnapore has never witnessed major hindu-muslim tensions in recent history.
the population of the city in 2022 is estimated to have crossed 190,000  due to high urbanisation and modernisation in recent times,which has caused a lot of immigration from all over the district.
