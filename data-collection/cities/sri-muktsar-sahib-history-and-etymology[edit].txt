early history[edit]
the modern day sri muktsar sahib city was historically a semi-desert terrain named khidrana or khidrane de dhab, situated near a lake. not much is known about the early history of the present area of the city. this may partly be due to the river sutlej. the sutlej is notorious for shifting its course, and it is stated to have flowed as far east as sri muktsar sahib within historical times. while shifting its course it is said to have leveled down everything that came its way, leaving behind ruins and mounds of earth and pottery debris. the present area of sri muktsar sahib is almost entirely destitute of ancient buildings and contains no places mentioned in early records. legends connected with raja sálbán attach to one or two other ruined sites near sri muktsar sahib such as that at sarainaga, 10 miles (16 km) to the east of sri muktsar sahib. but the city does not date from an earlier period than the reign of akbar.
medieval history[edit]
the territory of which sri muktsar sahib now forms a part of was formerly ruled by the paramara rajputs who held it for a considerable period. jiwa moved to the neighborhood of sri muktsar sahib where his descendants held a group of villages, and his grandson abdulla khan became the zaildar of sri muktsar sahib.
about the time of the first muslim conquests of india, a colony of bhati rajputs, of whose stock the tribes of manj, naipal and dogra rajputs are branches, came from jaisalmer under a leader, called rai hel, and settled to the south of the present town of sri muktsar sahib. they overcame the local paramara chief and firmly established themselves. burar had two sons, paur and dhul, the younger of whom held almost the whole of the region of sri muktsar sahib. many of these bhati rajputs followed the sikh gurus and later embraced the sikh faith, during the times of guru gobind singh ji. these bhati rajputs are known to have fought against the imperial muslim armies alongside guru gobind singh ji.
during the decay of the delhi empire, the country, which had apparently become almost depopulated, was occupied by the various clans of rajput origin, who are still prominent among the occupants of sri muktsar sahib.
the area has many people who are converted descendants of the chauhans of delhi, emigrated some years ago to the neighbourhood of pakpattan; and from thence, two centuries ago, spread for a hundred miles along both banks of the river sutlej from a  few miles above ferozepur to the borders of bahawalpur. at one time they were undoubted masters of mamdot and khai, as well as of ferozepor including the present area of sri muktsar sahib; their seats were principally in the khadir of the sutlej, and their occupations pastoral and predatory.
in march 1504, the second sikh guru, guru angad dev ji, was born at matte-di-sarai (now called sarainaga), about 6 miles from sri muktsar sahib. his father bhai pheru was a trehan khatri merchant, and mother, ramo, a housewife.
battle of sri muktsar sahib[edit]

in 1705, after battle of chamkaur against the mughals, guru gobind singh ji started looking out for a suitable place from where he could re-group his forces and battle the mughal forces, who were now supported by the dogra hill chiefs. assisted by an experienced guide of a brar chief, the guru reached khidrane di dhab where he finally decided to meet the enemy. he received news of imperial troops, at least 10,000 strong, under wazir khan, subedar of sirhind pursuing him. earlier, in 1704, when guru gobind singh ji's army was treacherously surrounded in anandpur sahib by the moghul forces, supported by dogra hill chiefs, sikhs had run out of provisions. some historians believe that 40 sikhs from majha region of jhabal had deserted the guru. historians believe that the guru asked them to write a formal declaration stating they no longer wish to fight alongside guru gobind singh ji. however, realizing their mistake of deserting him, and under the motivation of mai bhago, these 40 deserters came back to join the guru's forces at sri muktsar sahib. guru gobind singh ji also sent reinforcements, though the number of sikh soldiers is disputed. historians like latif have put it at 12,000, although the sikh chroniclers say they were far fewer, some say as few as forty. they showered arrows from his strategic position on the mound, down upon the imperial army, killing a number of them. the resistance of the sikhs became fierce. the enemy became restive for want of water. it was not possible for them to reach the lake of khidrana. as it was semi-desert terrain and the summer heat was reaching its peak, the guru knew of its importance and based his defenses around the water reservoir. the only water they could get was fifteen miles behind them. thirst and oppressive heat, and the tough resistance offered by the sikhs, compelled the mughal army to retreat. guru gobind singh ji won this last mughal-khalsa battle, which had resulted in heavy casualties. at the end of the battle, when he was looking for survivors, mai bhago, who was lying wounded, told him how the forty deserters had laid down their lives fighting in the battlefield. mai bhago recovered and remained in the guru's presence after the battle of sri muktsar sahib. when guru gobind singh ji (and bibi sharanjit kaur), along with his sikhs, was collecting the dead bodies for cremation, he found one man, named mahan singh, still clinging to life. on seeing the guru, he made an effort to rise; the guru at once took him in his embrace, and sat down with him. mahan singh, tearful and exhausted, requested the guru to destroy the document disclaiming his being a sikh of the guru. before mahan singh died, guru gobind singh ji took the document and tore it up. it is a legendary belief that this gave "mukti", meaning freedom, to those 40 sikhs and hence, the city got its modern-day name muktsar, where the word "sar" is derived from the word "sarovar", meaning reservoir, with reference to the kidrana reservoir.
post battle of sri muktsar sahib[edit]
in the days of persecution of the sikhs, jassa singh often took refuge in the jungles of sri muktsar sahib.
the territories of sri muktsar sahib, kotkapura, mari and mudki together with the faridkot state, formed originally one territory, with its capital at kotkapura. in 1807, dewan mokham chand conquered the whole of this territory from tegh singh, and added it to the lahore demesne. mohkam chand established thanas at sri muktsar sahib, kotkapura and mari and since that time the villages subject to these thanas have been known as separate territories.
ram singh, leader of the namdhari sect, visited sri muktsar sahib in 1861 on the occasion of mela maghi to deliver his message. however, the priests of sri muktsar sahib gurudwara refused to pray for ram singh, unless he agreed, by way of penalty for his "un-sikh" ways, to pay the entire cost of masonry for the local tank.
modern history[edit]
after india gained independence from the british in august 1947, there was an aggressive exodus of the non-muslims from west punjab and that of muslims from the east punjab. a large number of refugees from the bahawalpur state and from montgomery and lahore districts entered india through the border along the firozpur district, of which sri muktsar sahib was a part of. according to the 1951 census, 349,767 refugees from pakistan settled in the firozpur district including the erstwhile sri muktsar sahib and moga tehsils.
the sri muktsar sahib city remained a tehsil of ferozepur district from august 1947 to august 1972, and then it became a teshil of the newly carved out district, faridkot. in november 1995, sri muktsar sahib became a district city. in february 2012, the city was officially renamed to sri muktsar sahib from muktsar.
