a train passing through saharanpur railway station
two major national highways pass through saharanpur — nh 709b and nh 344. the nh 709b originates in saharanpur and connects it to delhi via shamli and baghpat, while the nh 344 connects saharanpur with ambala, yamunanagar and roorkee. uttar pradesh state highway 57, commonly known as delhi-yamunotri highway, also passes through the city. the delhi–saharanpur–dehradun expressway has also been proposed, which will be ready by march 2024.
saharanpur junction is the primary railway station serving the city. the station is under the administrative control of ambala railway division of the northern railways, and is located at the junction of moradabad–ambala line, delhi–meerut–saharanpur line and the delhi–shamli–saharanpur line. saharanpur was connected with rail lines when the scinde, punjab & delhi railway completed the 483-kilometre-long (300 mi) amritsar–ambala–saharanpur–ghaziabad line in 1870 connecting multan (now in pakistan) with delhi. another line connecting saharanpur with moradabad was completed in 1886.
the shahdara–saharanpur light railway connecting shahdara in delhi with saharanpur was opened to traffic in 1907. the railway was built in 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge and total length was 94.24 miles (151.66 km). however, due to increasing losses, the railway was closed in 1970. it was later converted to 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge and was repopened in the late 1970s. saharanpur falls on the route of the proposed 1,839-kilometre (1,143 mi) eastern dedicated freight corridor project.
