dibrugarh derived its name from dibarumukh (as a renowned encampment of ahoms during the ahom-chutia conflict). either the name “dibru” evolved from dibaru river or from the bodo-kachari word “dibru” which means a “blister” and “garh” meaning "fort". the bodo-kacharis add the prefix “di-” (which means “water”) wherever there is small stream, a river, or a large river in a town or city.
