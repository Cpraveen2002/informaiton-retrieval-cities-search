loni is listed in the ain-i-akbari, an mughal period document, as a pargana under the delhi sarkar subdivision, producing a revenue of 3,278,878 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 200 infantry and 20 cavalry. it had a brick fort at the time.
in the 14th century, an invasion by timur took place in the town and fort of loni a few days before the battle against delhi's tughlaq sultan mahmud shah. one of timur's emirs expressed the fear that the men, women and children they were dragging with them would break free and attack from the rear while the army was occupied in battle. timur's solution was to have a hundred thousand adult hindu males slaughtered before the battle. he insisted that individual owners would put their own slaves to death rather than outsource the task. anybody failing to kill would be killed himself.
