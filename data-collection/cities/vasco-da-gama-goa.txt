vasco da gama (/ˌvæskoʊ də ˈɡæmə/), often shortened to vasco, is a city in the state of goa on the west coast of india. it is named after the portuguese explorer vasco da gama. it is the headquarters of the mormugão taluka (subdistrict). the city lies on the western tip of the mormugao peninsula, at the mouth of the zuari river, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from panaji, goa's capital, 28 kilometres (17 mi) from margao, the district headquarters and about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from dabolim airport.
the city was founded in 1543 and remained in portuguese hands until 1961, when goa ceased to be a portuguese territory. the 1888-constructed mormugao port remains a busy shipping route in asia. it is one of the major ports of independent india. the shipbuilding area of goa shipyard limited that builds indian navy and coast guard vessels was also built there in 1957 (during the portuguese era). initially built around the city's harbour as the 'estaleiros navais de goa', the area has, since the end of portuguese presence, expanded into construction for several other branches of maritime patrol and security. the indian navy has an obvious presence here, with its vast campuses and ports, which include the naval base ins hansa.
