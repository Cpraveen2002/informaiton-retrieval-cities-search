culture and films[edit]
the film 'tanu weds manu' (2011) had some scenes shot in kapurthala city and kala sanghian. kapurthala gives its name to the kapurthala stomacher, a wedding gift from the maharajah to mary of teck, the future queen mary, in 1893. in the 2010 pakistani drama dastaan, a period drama that is set during the partition of india, kapurthala serves as the place where bano, the main muslim female character, is kept for nearly five years by a sikh family. parts of hindi movie firangi (2017) were shot at sainik school kapurthala (jagjit palace). the appearance of the palace is different in the film compared to how it is in reality and it appears that parts of the school building were painted for the film as well the structure was altered using cgi.
