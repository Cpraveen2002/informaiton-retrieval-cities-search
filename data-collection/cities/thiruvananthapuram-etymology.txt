etymology
the city takes its name from malayalam word thiru-anantha-puram (തിരുവനന്തപുരം [t̪iɾuʋɐnɐn̪d̪ɐpuɾɐm] (listen)), meaning "the city of lord ananta", referring to the deity of the sri padmanabhaswamy temple located in the city. thiruvananthapuram is also known in literature, and popular reference as ananthapuri, derived from the sanskrit word syanandurapuram, meaning "the city of bliss" in carnatic kirtanas composed by swathi thirunal, erstwhile maharaja of travancore. the city was officially referred to as trivandrum until 1991 (trivandrum being the anglicised name of the town), when the government decided to reinstate the city's original name thiruvananthapuram.
