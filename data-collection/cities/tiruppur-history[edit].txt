tiruppur formed a part of the kongu nadu region ruled by the cheras during sangam period. the region was part of a prominent roman trade route that connected east and west coasts of india. the medieval cholas conquered the kongu nadu in the tenth century ce and chola stone carvings mention kanchi maanadhi (noyyal river) and the fertile sand that it deposited on its banks.
the region came under the rule of the vijayanagara empire by the 15th century and later palayakkarars, the chieftains of madurai nayaks ruled the region. in the later part of the 18th century, the region came under the kingdom of mysore, following a series of wars with the madurai nayak dynasty. after the defeat of tipu sultan in the anglo-mysore wars, the british east india company annexed the region into the madras presidency in 1799.
tiruppur was an agricultural town with irrigated farms and the farmers became small owners of various textile related units during the 1970s. the boom in the textile industry led to an inter woven network of the small scale units leading to growth of the city into a major textile hub. tiruppur became a municipal corporation in 2008 and a separate tiruppur district was carved out from parts of coimbatore district and erode district in 2009.
