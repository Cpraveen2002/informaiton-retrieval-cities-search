history[edit]
katihar is a part of the mithila region. mithila first gained prominence after being settled by indo-aryan peoples who established the mithila kingdom (also called kingdom of the videhas).
during the late vedic period (c. 1100–500 bce), kingdom of the videhas became one of the major political and cultural centers of south asia, along with kuru and pañcāla. the kings of the kingdom of the videhas were called janakas. the mithila kingdom was later incorporated into the vajjika league, which had its capital in the city of vaishali, which is also in mithila.
