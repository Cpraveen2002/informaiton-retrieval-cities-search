gandhidham was the dream of pratap dialdas. bhai pratap dialdas requested great leaders of india for the procurement of land in the kachchh region. they requested maharao vijayraj ji of kachchh for granting of land for re-settlement of sindhi community people migrated from sindh. maharao, without any delay, granted 15000 acres of land for the purpose. bhai pratap said this is too big land and cannot be developed by src ltd, therefore, he desired to keep with him only 2,600 acres, and the rest of the land was given to kpt and gda for management. today adipur and gandhidham townships are the townships of pride in the district of kachchh only with the grace of rajput kshatriya ancestors – provided by ram amarnani.
distance between twin-townships of adipur & gandhidham is 6  km still not developed fully and 0  km if full land constructed. the airport road dividing wards 5 & 7 divides these townships, whereas municipality is one, known as gandhidham municipality. these towns are divided in two parts wherein land is recognized as wards & sectors. townships have six wards each 1to6 in adipur and 7to12 in gandhidham. these wards consist of commercial, industrial and residential plots of land. the land which is owned and managed by src (the sindhu resettlement corporation ltd) is known as 'wards' and the land which is owned and managed by kpt (kandla port trust) is known as 'sectors'. there are 13 such sectors in gandhidham. apart from this, there is vast land managed by gda (gandhidham development authority) which is known as "nu". for the construction of any permanent structure in these townships, the permission of gda is a must.
