Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
shimla city gets its name from shyamala mata, a fearless incarnation of the goddess kali. the temple of the goddess is situated on bantony hill, near the ridge, named kali bari temple. according to another version shimla gets its name from the word 'shyamalaya' meaning blue slate by faqir on jakhu. but generally, society finds the first version more believable, acceptable and reasonable.
in 2018, the state government decided to change the city's name from shimla to shyamala. however, seeing the negative response of public and the locals, state government dismissed the plan.
