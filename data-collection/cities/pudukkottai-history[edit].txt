the princely state of pudukottai was created by raghunatha kilavan setupati of ramnad (1673–1708 a.d.) married kathali nachiar, the sister of thondaiman. he appointed his brother-in-law, raghunatha thondaiman, as chief of the district of pudukottai. raghunatha thondaiman earlier had ruled thirumayam. in appreciation of raghunatha thondaiman's services, raghunatha kilavan setupati gave pudukkottai as an honor for his services. in later centuries, the thondaiman rulers, while nominally feudatories of the ramnad state, often pursued an independent foreign policy, a trend common in all parts of india at that time. after the death of raghunatha kilavan setupati raghunatha thondaiman become ruler of pudukottai.
after becoming the ruler of pudukottai, thondaiman fought against the nayaks of tanjore in support of the nayaks of madurai and conquered thirukkattupalli, a very important place. then there was a direct clash between the thondaimans of pudukottai and the nayaks, rulers of tanjore. thondaiman conquered the west of thirukkattupalli. the next ruler, raja vijaya reghunatha raya thondaiman, helped the arcot nawab against hyder ali, the ruler of mysore. he was also loyal to the british government. after some time, when hyder ali's army tried to enter pudukkottai, thondaiman's army defeated them and drove hyder's army away. thondaiman captured kilanilai and aranthangi. he helped the british government against tipu sultan.
pudukkotai finally came under formal british protection. this was arguably unavoidable since the thondaimans were much menaced in that period by a resurgent mysore, ruled by hyder ali and tipu sultan. when tipu sultan sought to leverage the power of the french against his british adversaries, pudukkotai, in common with its neighbors, such as thanjavur and travancore, found it expedient to ally with the british.
raja rajagopala thondaiman (1928–1948), the last and ninth in the line of thondaiman rulers, was selected by the british government and was crowned when he was six years old. after indian independence in 1947, the pudukkottai princely state was amalgamated with the indian union on 3 april 1948 and became a division in tiruchirappalli district. the long history of the thondaimans' rule came to an end.
