etymology[edit]
the name thrissur (malayalam: തൃശൂര്) is a shortened form of the malayalam word thirusshivaperoor (തിരുശ്ശിവപ്പേരൂർ, place of lord shiva's name). the name owes itself to the most prominent feature of the city, that is the vadakkumnathan temple, which has shiva as its presiding deity. thrissur was known by its anglicised name trichur until 1990, when the government decided to replace it with its malayalam name. thrissur was also known as "vrishabhadripuram" (kailasam of the south) in ancient days.
