panchkula
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the word is derived from the local word panch (sanskrit: पंच) (five) and kula (sanskrit: कुला) (canals) "the city of 5 canals", possibly referring to five irrigation canals that distribute water from the ghaggar river and these kuls pass through the chandimandir cantonment area to mata mansa devi mandir area. kuls or canals were made along the contours of the hillocks in a way that they collect the water upstream and convey it downstream at the contour height higher than the actual level of the ghaggar river at the same spot. one of the canal is called the singh nalla which was being beautified in 2021 by building a walking track and by planting the plants and flowers.
