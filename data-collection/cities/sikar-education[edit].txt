over the past decade, a burgeoning coaching industry has catapulted sikar into a popular education hub, concurrently stimulating the local economy and augmenting the prominence of this previously obscure town. thousands of high school students from neighboring areas, and increasingly from far-flung corners, flock every year to enroll in one of the wide array of sikar's premier coaching institutes, which prepare them for the notoriously competitive engineering and medical entrance examinations that preface the greatly coveted iits and medical colleges.
the city also attracts a substantial number of college undergraduates and post-graduates seeking coaching for the competitive exams that determine their government job prospects. with regards to higher education institutes, sikar boasts several leading public and private universities offering sciences, arts, and engineering degrees, such as the shri kalyan government college and pandit deendayal upadhyaya shekhawati university. most notably, the government recently established the sikar medical college, a varsity part of the distinguished, nationwide public medical college network.
this newfound stature and renown has led the media to dub sikar as the "education city of rajasthan", and colloquially, as the 'kota of northern rajasthan,' owing to kota's status as the coaching capital of india.
