description[edit]
the city consists of three distinct portions: the citadel, the fort and the remains of the city. the citadel, built by the adilshahi sultans, a mile in circuit, is of great strength, well built of the most massive materials, and encompassed by a ditch 100 yards (91 m) wide, formerly supplied with water. the fort, which was completed by the adilshahi sultans in 1566, is surrounded by a wall 6 m. in circumference. this wall is from 30 to 50 ft (15 m) high, and is strengthened with ninety-six massive bastions of various designs. in addition there are ten others at the various gateways. the width is about 25 ft (7.6 m); from bastion to bastion runs a battlement curtained wall about 10 ft (3.0 m) high. the whole is surrounded by a deep moat 30 to 40 ft (12 m) broad. inside these walls the bijapur kings bade defiance to all comers. outside the walls are the remains of a vast city, now for the most part in ruins, but the innumerable tombs, mosques, which have resisted the havoc of time, afford abundant evidence of the ancient splendor of the place. badami, aihole, and pattadakal, near bijapur, are noted for their historical temples in the chalukya architectural style.
