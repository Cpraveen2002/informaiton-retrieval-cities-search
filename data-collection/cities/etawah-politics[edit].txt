politics[edit]
until the 1980s, the regional politics was largely dominated by the congress. the region saw several changes in the succeeding decades which led to a reconfiguration of political power. until the 80s the upper castes often used coercion to get votes from the lower caste majority in the region. the lower castes began to assert themselves much more forcefully. two leaders, chaudhary charan singh, a jat leader who briefly became prime minister in 1979, and mulayam singh yadav became faces for opposition to the congress. moreover, dacoits from backward castes strengthened, asserting control over land and political power.
