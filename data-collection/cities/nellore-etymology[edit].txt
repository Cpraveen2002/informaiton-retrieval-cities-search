nellore
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
there are various theories linked to the origin of the name "nellore". a mythological story from sthala purana depicts, a lingam in the form of a stone under nelli tree ("nelli" stands for emblica tree in tamil). the place gradually became nelli-ooru (ooru generally stands for place in telugu) and then to present day nellore. another explanation is that the town got its name from the extensive cultivation of paddy in and around it ("nell"  meaning paddy in telugu). the gazetteer of the nellore district considers the latter the more plausible etymology.
