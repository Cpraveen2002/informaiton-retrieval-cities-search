there are a total of 400 existing beds for patients in different wards of raiganj district hospital. however, there was no infrastructure for the treatment of dying patients and the patients who suffer from complicated diseases of the kidney and heart. hence, on most occasions, complicated patients are transferred either to north bengal medical college & hospital in siliguri or malda medical college and even to kolkata which is 444Â km away. the patient parties are facing great crisis to shift their patients either to siliguri or malda. sometimes, patients die on the way as a result of complexities.
on 27 november, the state chief minister mamata banerjee during her visit to raiganj announced that raiganj district hospital would be upgraded to a super specialty hospital and to start new raiganj medical college & hospital in 2018.
