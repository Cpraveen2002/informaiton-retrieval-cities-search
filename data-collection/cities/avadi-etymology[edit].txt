avadi
Etymology[edit]
etymology[edit]
the exact origin of the name 'avadi' is not known. one version has it that it is the combination of "aa" (meaning cow) and "adi or gudi (kudi)" (meaning place in tamil), indicating that the place had many cows. avadi stands for armed vehicles ammunition depot of india one of the more popular theories about the origin of the name is that it is an acronym for "armoured vehicles and ammunition depot of india". however, this is most likely a backronym invented more recently. the entity "armoured vehicles and ammunition depot of india" does not appear in any british records.
several british documents from the 19th century refer to the place as "avady", which doesn't match the widely circulated acronym theory. the name avadi (avady) was already in use by 1856, when the first public railway was opened in the madras presidency. this predates the transfer of the madras presidency's arsenal from fort st. george, india in the city of madras, to avadi, which was done sometime after 1870, which contradicts the popular acronym theory.
