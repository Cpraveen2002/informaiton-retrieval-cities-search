industry[edit]
major industrial areas surrounding ujjain are "dewas road industrial area", "maxi road industrial area" and "tajpur industrial area".
the government of madhya pradesh has allotted 1,200 acres for the development of an industrial area on the dewas-ujjain road near narwar village. originally named "vikramaditya knowledge city", the area was envisaged as an educational hub. due to diminished investment prospects, it was renamed to "vikram udyog nagari" ("vikram industrial city"). as of 2014, the government has conceptualized it as a half-industrial, half-educational area. the stakeholders in the project include the state government and the delhi mumbai industrial corridor (dmic) trust.
