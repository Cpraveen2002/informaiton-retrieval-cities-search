etymology[edit]
dudhrej was originally a nes (hamlet) settled by the charanas. one shastam swami wanted a temple to be built on the bank of the tank, so he started a shrine. the charan ladies of the village would pour milk (dudh) over a particular place at the shrine due to which the place began to be known as dudhrej.
