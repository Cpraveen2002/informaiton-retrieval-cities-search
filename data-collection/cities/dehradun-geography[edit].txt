the city of dehradun mainly lies in doon valley and is at a varying height from 410 m (1,350 ft) in clement town to above 700 m (2,300 ft) at malsi which is 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city. however, the average elevation is 450 m (1,480 ft) above sea level. malsi is the starting point of lesser himalayan range that extends to mussoorie and beyond. jaunsar-bawar hills in dehradun district rises to 3,700 m (12,100 ft) above sea level. the hilly region of mussoorie goes up to a height of 1,870–2,017 m (6,135–6,617 ft) above sea level. its geomorphological and meteorological characteristics make it prone to a number of natural hazards. beside earthquakes, the region is frequently devastated by landslides, cloudbursts, flash-floods, cold waves and hailstorms.
the doon valley contains the settlements including raiwala, rishikesh, doiwala, harrawala, dehradun, herbertpur, vikasnagar, sahaspur, selaqui, subhash nagar and clement town. the district houses rajaji national park which is home to elephants, benog wildlife sanctuary at mussoorie & asan conservation reserve (asan barrage). the doon valley has the terai and bhabar forests within it as well as the shivalik hills and lesser himalayan range containing hill stations such as mussoorie and chakrata. the district is bordered by the himalayas in the north, rajaji range of the sivalik hills to the south, the river ganges to the east, and the yamuna river to the west. towns in the foothills of the mountain ranges include sahastradhara, lakhamandal, gautam kund, chandrabani, kalsi and dakpathar.
this district is divided into two major parts: the main city dehradun surrounded by shivalik and the jaunsar-bawar, which is in the foothills of himalayas. in the north and northwest it borders on the district of uttarkashi and tehri garhwal, in the east and southeast by pauri garhwal and ganges river, in the west, it is bordered by shimla and sirmaur districts of himachal pradesh, yamunanagar district of haryana and the tons and yamuna rivers. to the south are haridwar and uttar pradesh's saharanpur district. it is between latitudes 30°01' n and 31°2'n and longitudes 77°34' e and 78°18'e. this district consists of six tehsils – dehradun, chakrata, vikasnagar, kalsi, tiuni and rishikesh – six community development blocks – vis, chakrata, kalsi, vikasnagar, sahaspur, rajpur and doiwala – 17 towns and 764 villages. out of these 746 villages are inhabited; 18 are uninhabited.
heritage canal network[edit]

main article: dehradun canals
there was once an extensive canal network in the city, which irrigated many surrounding villages and produced a cooler microclimate in the region. the earliest canal, rajpur canal, was laid in the 17th century. after dehradun became the state capital in 2000, most of the heritage canals were covered or demolished to widen the city roads. environmental groups have campaigned for the revival of the network, citing its benefit for the city's ecology, aesthetics, microclimate and built environment.
