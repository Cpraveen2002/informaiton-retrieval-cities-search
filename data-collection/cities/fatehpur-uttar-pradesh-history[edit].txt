history[edit]
the known history of fatehpur is as old as the vedic era. cunnigham has written about "bhitaura" and "asani" places of this district, while discussing about the residuals of the vedic era. there are proofs that chinese traveller huen tsang visited the asani place of this district.
in the village renh, which is 25 km  south-west of fatehpur town, some articles of archaeological interest have been found, from around 800 bc. many articles like coins, bricks, idols etc. of the maurya period, kushan period and gupta period have been found throughout the area, which are very important from the archaeological point of view. golden coins of period of chandragupta ii have been recovered from village bijauli. the bricks used in the fort of asani are also of the gupta period. the khajuha town, situated on mughal road is a very old town. its description has been found in the old hindu scripture "brahma purana". in 1561 ad, moghal emperor humayun passed through this town while invading jaunpur state. on 5 january 1659, moghal emperor aurangzeb had a fierce battle with his brother prince shahshuja, and killed him near this place. to celebrate the victory, he constructed a large beautiful garden "badshahi bagh" and a big lodge having 130 rooms.
during the moghul regime, the control of fatehpur shifted over time to the hands of jaunpur, delhi and kannauj. in 1801, this region came under control of the east india company, and in 1814 it was given the status of a sub-division (paragana), while the headquarters were at bhitaura, which is now a block office. in 1826, fatehpur was re-designated as a district headquarters.
