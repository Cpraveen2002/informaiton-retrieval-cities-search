history[edit]
in the 13th century, vaishnavite saint madhvacharya founded the sri krishna temple. he set up eight mathas - ashta mathas- in kannada - ಅಷ್ಟ ಮಠಗಳು in udupi to propagate the dvaita vedanta philosophy, and this caused a vibrant temple culture to take root in present-day udupi district. significant migration of brahmins to the region took place subsequently, and they came to comprise 10 per cent of the region's population, three times higher than elsewhere in south india.
