clay mounds of coins discovered at khokhrakot have thrown light on the process of casting coins in ancient india. the coin moulds of the later yaudheyas of the 3rd or 4th century ad have been discovered in large number here, along with several clay seals of the same and subsequent dates. a gupta terracotta plaque and a head of later date have also been discovered. the town continued to flourish till the 10th century ad, as coins of king samanta deva of the hindu shahi have been found here. the town was conquered by the ghaznavids under ibrahim of ghazna between 1060-1080.
rohtak is listed in the ain-i-akbari as a pargana under delhi sarkar, producing a revenue of 8,599,270 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 2000 infantry and 100 cavalry. the existence of a brick fort was also noted. it is also mentioned in vipakasutra, one of twelve ancient texts of svetambara jainism, written around ninth century ad, as a kingdom of kings vesamanadatta and pusyanandi. later, chahamanas ruled in the city region.
