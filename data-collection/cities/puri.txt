puri (odia: [ˈpuɾi] (listen)) is a coastal city and a municipality in the state of odisha in eastern india. it is the district headquarters of puri district and is situated on the bay of bengal, 60 kilometres (37 mi) south of the state capital of bhubaneswar. it is also known as sri jagannatha dhama after the 12th-century jagannath temple located in the city. it is one of the original char dham  pilgrimage sites for hindus.
puri is known by several names since the ancient times, and was locally known as "sri kshetra" and the jagannath temple is known as "badadeula". puri and the jagannath temple were invaded 18 times by muslim rulers, from the 7th century ad till the early 19th century with the objective of looting the treasures of the temple. odisha, including puri and its temple, were part of british india from 1803 till india attained independence in august 1947. even though princely states do not exist in india today, the heirs of the house of gajapati still perform the ritual duties of the temple. the temple town has many hindu religious mathas or monasteries.
the economy of puri is dependent on the religious importance of the jagannath temple to the extent of nearly 80 percent. the 24 festivals, including 13 major ones, held every year in the temple complex contribute to the economy; ratha yatra and its related festivals are the most important which are attended by millions of people every year. sand art and applique art are some of the important crafts of the city.
puri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for heritage city development and augmentation yojana (hriday) scheme of government of india.
puri is a significant part of the "krishna pilgrimage circuit" which also includes mathura, vrindavan, barsana, gokula, govardhan, kurukshetra and dwarka.
