from 1350 onwards, lucknow and parts of the awadh region were ruled by the delhi sultanate, sharqi sultanate, mughal empire, nawabs of awadh, the british east india company and the british raj.
for about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), awadh was part of the sharqi sultanate of jaunpur. emperor humayun made it a part of the mughal empire around 1555. emperor jahangir (1569–1627) granted an estate in awadh to a favoured nobleman, sheikh abdul rahim, who later built machchi bhawan on this estate. it later became the seat of power from where his descendants, the sheikhzadas, controlled the region.

the nawabs of lucknow, in reality, the nawabs of awadh, acquired the name after the reign of the third nawab when lucknow became their capital. the city became north india's cultural capital, and its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts. under their dominion, music and dance flourished, and construction of numerous monuments took place. of the monuments standing today, the bara imambara, the chota imambara, and the rumi darwaza are notable examples. one of the nawab's enduring legacies is the region's syncretic hindu–muslim culture that has come to be known as the ganga-jamuni tehzeeb.

until 1719, the subah of awadh was a province of the mughal empire administered by a governor appointed by the emperor. persian adventurer saadat khan, also known as burhan-ul-mulk, was appointed nizam of awadh in 1722 and established his court in faizabad, near lucknow.
many independent kingdoms, such as awadh, were established as the mughal empire disintegrated. the third nawab, shuja-ud-daula (r. 1753–1775), fell out with the british after aiding the fugitive nawab of bengal, mir qasim. roundly defeated at the battle of buxar by the east india company, he was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender parts of his territory. awadh's capital, lucknow rose to prominence when asaf-ud-daula, the fourth nawab, shifted his court to the city from faizabad in 1775. the british east india company appointed a resident (ambassador) in 1773 and by early 19th century gained control of more territory and authority in the state. they were, however, disinclined to capture awadh outright and come face to face with the maratha empire and the remnants of the mughal empire. in 1798, the fifth nawab wazir ali khan alienated both his people and the british and was forced to abdicate. the british then helped saadat ali khan take the throne. he became a puppet king, and in a treaty of 1801, yielded large part of awadh to the east india company while also agreeing to disband his own troops in favour of a hugely expensive, british-controlled army. this treaty effectively made the state of awadh a vassal of the east india company, although it continued to be part of the mughal empire in name until 1819. the treaty of 1801 proved a beneficial arrangement for the east india company as they gained access to awadh's vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. in addition, the revenues from running awadh's armed forces brought them useful returns while the territory acted as a buffer state. the nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show. by the mid-nineteenth century, however, the british had grown impatient with the arrangement and demanded direct control over awadh.

in 1856 the east india company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state for alleged maladministration. awadh was placed under a chief commissioner – sir henry lawrence. wajid ali shah, the then nawab, was imprisoned, then exiled by the east india company to calcutta. in the subsequent indian rebellion of 1857, his 14-year-old son birjis qadra, whose mother was begum hazrat mahal, was crowned ruler. following the rebellion's defeat, begum hazrat mahal and other rebel leaders sought asylum in nepal.

lucknow was one of the major centres of the indian rebellion of 1857 and actively participated in india's independence movement, emerging as a strategically important north indian city. during the rebellion (also known as the first war of indian independence and the indian mutiny), the majority of the east india company's troops were recruited from both the people and nobility of awadh. the rebels seized control of the state, and it took the british 18 months to reconquer the region. during that period, the garrison based at the residency in lucknow was besieged by rebel forces during the siege of lucknow. the siege was relieved first by forces under the command of sir henry havelock and sir james outram, followed by a stronger force under sir colin campbell. today, the ruins of the residency and the shaheed smarak offer an insight into lucknow's role in the events of 1857.
with the rebellion over, oudh returned to british governance under a chief commissioner. in 1877 the offices of lieutenant-governor of the north-western provinces and chief commissioner of oudh were combined; then in 1902, the title of chief commissioner was dropped with the formation of the united provinces of agra and oudh, although oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.

the khilafat movement had an active base of support in lucknow, creating united opposition to british rule. in 1901, after remaining the capital of oudh since 1775, lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged into the newly formed united provinces of agra and oudh. in 1920 the provincial seat of government moved from allahabad to lucknow. upon indian independence in 1947, the united provinces were reorganised into the state of uttar pradesh, and lucknow remained its capital.
lucknow witnessed some of the pivotal moments in the history of india. one is the first meeting of the stalwarts mahatma gandhi, jawaharlal nehru and mohd ali jinnah during the indian national congress session of 1916 (the lucknow pact was signed and moderates and extremists came together through the efforts of annie besant during this session only). the congress president for that session, ambica charan majumdar in his address said that "if the congress was buried at surat, it is reborn in lucknow in the garden of wajid ali shah".
the kakori conspiracy involving ram prasad bismil, ashfaq ullah khan, rajendra nath lahiri, roshan singh and others followed by the kakori trial which captured the imagination of the country also took place in lucknow.
culturally, lucknow has also had a tradition of courtesans, with popular culture distilling it in the avatar of the fictional umrao jaan.
