a panorama of the stadium.
in 1990, the punjab cricket association (pca) unveiled a plan to build a state-of-the-art facility complete with a separate practice ground—to be built in a swampy area in the city.  the pca invested heavily in the ground, a swimming pool, health club, tennis court, library, restaurant, and bar and outdoor & indoor cricket practice nets were incorporated into the plans.
the construction of the stadium took around ₹25 crores and 3 years to complete. the stadium has an official capacity of 30000 spectators. the stadium was designed by arun loomba and associates, panchkula and constructed by r.s. construction company, chandigarh. the lights here are unconventional compared to other cricket stadiums, in that the light pillars are very low in height. this is to avoid aircraft from the nearby airport colliding with the light pillars. the stream passing through the central part of chandigarh called n choe, also passes alongside the stadium.
