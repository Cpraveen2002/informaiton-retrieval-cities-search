the andhra pradesh state cabinet meeting passed a resolution of 1 september 2014 to locate the capital city in a central place of the state, around vijayawada, and to go for decentralized development of the state with 3 mega cities and 14 smart cities. the state government identified the capital city area between vijayawada and guntur cities on the southern bank of river krishna upstream of prakasam barrage. the amaravati capital city has an area of 217.23 km and is spread across 25 villages in 3 mandals (thullur, mangalagiri and tadepalli) of guntur district. the 25 villages in the capital city area have about 1 lakh population in about 27,000 households. the nearest cities are vijayawada at a distance of 30 km and guntur at a distance of 18 km. the nearest railway station is kc canal railway station near tadepalli and the nearest airport is gannavaram which is at a distance of 22 km. the city is planned to spread over 217 km area with a total cost of ₹ 553.43 billions to the capital region development authority (crda) out of which state government contribution is only ₹ 126 billion (equity ₹ 66.29 billion and supporting grant ₹ 59.71 billion) spread over a period of 8 years from april 2018 to march 2026 (₹ 5 billion in 2018–19, ₹ 18 billion per year for later six years and ₹ 13 billion in 2025–26).

the contribution from the government is to be repaid by the crda after 2037. ultimately state or union governments are not incurring any expenditure to construct the city but wholly financed by the income accrued from the sale of land for various development schemes (₹ 171.51 billion), loans and the local taxes (₹ 146.41 billion by 2037) to the crda. the state and union governments are expected to earn ₹ 120 billion per annum out of which state goods and services tax (state gst) alone is ₹ 60 billion per annum. the entire city construction is planned by self-financing from loans and land selling with the state government's moral support. crda is expecting a net surplus income of ₹ 333 billion by 2037 after meeting the total expenditure on the city. amaravati government complex which is intended to provide world-class facilities needed for the state government and its employees' accommodation is also part of the crda project. the bus rapid transit system (brts) in amaravati to connect with the adjacent vijayawada and guntur cities by world-class road network is also part of the crda project. both amaravati government complex and brts are planned with an expenditure of ₹ 140 billion.
