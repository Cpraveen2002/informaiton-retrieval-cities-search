vasai-virar, formerly bassein or vasai, is a city (municipal corporation) in western maharashtra state, western india. it lies on the arabian sea coast north of mumbai (bombay). vasai town was part of the territory of the hindu devagiri yadavas until 1317, and it later became a seaport for the gujarat muslim kings. in 1526 the portuguese established a fort (now in ruins) and trading station at vasai, and the town became famous for its shipbuilding industry.
the portuguese, with their naval power and their crusading valor, were unquestioned masters of the indian ocean. when the portuguese arrived, vasai was under the rule of bahadur shah, the sultan of gujarat.
