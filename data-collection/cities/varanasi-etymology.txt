varanasi
Etymology
etymology
traditional etymology links "varanasi" to the names of two ganges tributaries forming the city's borders: varuna, still flowing in northern varanasi, and assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near assi ghat. the old city is located on the north shores of the ganges, bounded by varuna and assi.
in the mahabharata the city is referred to as kāśī (काशी: kashi) from the sanskrit verbal root kaś- "to shine", making varanasi known as "city of light", the "luminous city as an eminent seat of learning". the name was also used by pilgrims dating from buddha's days.
hindu religious texts use many epithets in sanskrit to refer to varanasi, such as kāśikā (transl. "the shining one"), avimukta (transl. "never forsaken by shiva"), ānandakānana (transl. "the forest of bliss"), rudravāsa (transl. "the place where rudra resides"), and mahāshmashāna (transl. "the great cremation ground").
