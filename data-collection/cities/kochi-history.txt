muziris, a port somewhere north of kochi (mostly identified with kodungallur in thrissur district), was the centre of indian spice trade for many centuries, and was known to the arabs, yavanas (greeks and romans) as well as jews, syrians, and chinese since ancient times. kochi rose to significance as a trading centre after the port muziris around kodungallur (cranganore) was destroyed by the massive flooding of periyar in 1341. the earliest documented references to kochi occur in books written by chinese voyager ma huan during his visit to kochi in the 15th century as part of admiral zheng he's treasure fleet. there are also references to kochi in accounts written by italian traveller niccolò da conti, who visited kochi in 1440. the ruler of perumpadappu (near ponnani) fled to kodungallur in the early medieval period, when the zamorin of calicut annexed ponnani region, after tirunavaya war. they later moved to kochi and established the kingdom of cochin. when vasco da gama landed at kozhikode and the zamorin of calicut fought against the portuguese with kunjali marakkar, the ruler of cochin aligned with the portuguese.
portuguese explorer pedro álvares cabral established portuguese influence in kochi (portuguese: cochim) in 1500, which lasted until 1663.
on the malabar coast during the early 15th century, calicut and kochi were in an intense rivalry, so the ming dynasty of china decided to intervene by granting special status to kochi and its ruler known as keyili (可亦里) to the chinese. calicut had been the dominant port-city in the region, but kochi was emerging as its main rival. for the fifth ming treasure voyage, admiral zheng he was instructed to confer a seal upon keyili of kochi and enfeoff a mountain in his kingdom as the zhenguo zhi shan (鎮國之山, mountain which protects the country). zheng he delivered a stone tablet, inscribed with a proclamation composed by the yongle emperor himself, to kochi. as long as kochi remained under the protection of ming china, the zamorin of calicut was unable to invade kochi and a military conflict was averted. the cessation of the ming treasure voyages consequently had negative results for kochi, as the zamorin of calicut would eventually launch an invasion against kochi. in the late 15th century, the zamorin occupied kochi and installed his representative as the king of the port-city.

according to many historians, the precursor state to kingdom of kochi came into existence in the early 12th century, after the fall of the chera kingdom. the reign of the kingdom was hereditary, and the family that ruled over the region was known as the perumpadappu swaroopam in the local vernacular.
the port at kozhikode held superior economic and political position in medieval kerala coast, while kannur, kollam, and kochi, were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather. the portuguese arrived at kappad kozhikode in 1498 during the age of discovery, thus opening a direct sea route from europe to india. portuguese navigator, pedro álvares cabral founded the first european settlement in india at kochi in 1500. from 1503 to 1663, fort kochi (fort emmanuel) was ruled by portugal. this portuguese period was a harrowing time for the saint thomas christians, muslim mappilas, and the jews, as the inquisition was active in portuguese india. the ruler of the kingdom of tanur, who was a vassal to the zamorin of calicut, sided with the portuguese, against his overlord at kozhikode. as a result, the kingdom of tanur (vettathunadu) became one of the earliest portuguese colonies in india. the ruler of tanur also sided with cochin. many of the members of the royal family of cochin in 16th and 17th centuries were selected from vettom. however, the tanur forces under the king fought for the zamorin of calicut in the battle of cochin (1504).  however, the allegiance of the mappila merchants in tanur region still stayed under the zamorin of calicut. kochi hosted the grave of vasco da gama, the first european explorer to set sail for india, who was buried at st. francis church until his remains were returned to portugal in 1539. the portuguese rule was followed by that of the dutch who renamed fort immanuel as fort stormsburg. in meantime, the royal family of kochi relocated the capital of kochi kingdom to thrissur, leaving nominal authority over islands of kochi. in 1664, fort kochi municipality was established by dutch, making it the first municipality in indian subcontinent, which got dissolved when dutch authority got weaker in the 18th century. the remaining part of kochi were governed by governors of kochi kingdom. by 1773, the mysore ruler hyder ali extended his conquest in the malabar region to kochi forcing it to become a tributary of mysore. the hereditary prime ministership of kochi held by the paliath achans ended during this period.

meanwhile, the dutch, fearing an outbreak of war on the united provinces, signed the anglo-dutch treaty of 1814 with the united kingdom, under which kochi was ceded to the united kingdom in exchange for the island of bangka, east of sumatra. however, there are evidences of english habitation in the region even before the signing of the treaty. in 1866, fort kochi municipality was reinstalled. fort kochi, which was a part of malabar district until 1956, was made a municipality on 1 november 1866,  along with kannur, thalassery, kozhikode, and palakkad, according to the madras act 10 of 1865 (amendment of the improvements in towns act 1850) of the british indian empire. its first municipal council seating contest was conducted in 1883. in 1896, h.h. rama varma xv, the maharaja of cochin, initiated local administration by forming town councils in mattancherry and ernakulam. in 1907, the governor of the madras presidency, sir arthur lawley and his brother, beilby lawley, 3rd baron wenlock, governor of madras, 1891 to 1896, left for an official tour of cochin and travancore, which lasted from 25 january to 14 february. on 26 january, they were met by his highness the rajah of cochin who gave a state dinner in their honour at ernakulam. by the 1870s, the capital of kochi kingdom was relocated again to kochi suburb of tripunithura. in 1910, ernakulam became the administrative capital of kochi kingdom with establishment of royal secretariat and state durbar. the offices of the diwan and high court were soon moved into ernakulam.

in 1925, kochi legislative assembly was constituted due to public pressure on the state. towards the early 20th century, trade at the port had increased substantially, and the need to develop the port was greatly felt. harbour engineer robert bristow was brought to kochi in 1920 under the direction of lord willingdon, then the governor of madras. in a span of 21 years, he transformed kochi as one of the safest harbours in the peninsula, where ships berthed alongside the newly reclaimed inner harbour equipped with a long array of steam cranes.
in 1947, when india gained independence from the british colonial rule, cochin was the first princely state to join india willingly. in 1949, travancore-cochin state came into being with the merger of cochin and travancore. the king of travancore was the rajpramukh of the travancore-cochin union from 1949 to 1956. travancore-cochin, was in turn merged with the malabar district of the madras state. finally, the government of india's states reorganisation act (1956) inaugurated a new state—kerala—incorporating travancore-cochin (excluding the four southern taluks which were merged with tamil nadu), malabar district, and the taluk of kasargod, south kanara. on 9 july 1960 the mattancherry council passed a resolution—which was forwarded to the government—requesting the formation of a municipal corporation by combining the existing municipalities of fort kochi, mattancherry, and ernakulam. the government appointed a commission to study the feasibility of the suggested merger. based on its report, the kerala legislative assembly approved the corporation's formation. on 1 november 1967, exactly eleven years since the establishment of the state of kerala, the kochi municipal corporation came into existence. the merger leading to the establishment of the corporation, was between the municipalities of ernakulam, mattancherry and fort kochi, along with that of the willingdon island, four panchayats (palluruthy, vennala, vyttila and edappally), and the small islands of gundu and ramanthuruth. the kochi and ernakulam districts formed on 1 april 1958 carving areas of the erstwhile travancore-kochi-malabar regions. a major portion of the district is from the kochi kingdom.
the city's economic growth gathered momentum after economic reforms in india introduced by the central government in the early 1990s. since 2000, the service sector has energised the city's economy. the establishment of several industrial parks based on it and other port based infrastructure triggered a construction and realty boom in the city. over the years, kochi has witnessed rapid commercialisation, and has today grown into the commercial hub of kerala.
