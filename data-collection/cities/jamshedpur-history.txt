history
the prospectors c. m. weld, dorabji tata and shapurji saklatvala took nearly three years in a painstaking search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location for a steel plant. one day they came across sakchi (present-day a business district), on the densely forested stretches of the chota nagpur plateau, near the confluence of the subarnarekha and kharkai rivers. it seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected.
in 1908, the construction of the plant as well as the city officially began. the first steel ingot was rolled on 16 february 1912. it was a momentous day in the history of industrial india.
jamsetji tata's plan for the city was clear. he envisioned far more than a mere row of workers' hutments. he insisted upon building all the comforts and conveniences a city could provide. as a result, many areas in the city are well planned and there are public leisure places such as the jubilee park. while building the city, tata had said:
"be sure to lay wide streets planted with shady trees, every other of a quick-growing variety. be sure that there is plenty of space for lawns and gardens; reserve large areas for football, hockey and parks; earmark areas for hindu temples, muslim mosques and christian churches."— jamsetji tata
messrs julin kennedy sahlin from pittsburgh prepared the first layout of the town of jamshedpur. jamshedpur is a million-plus city with three municipal corporations, jamshedpur notified area committee, jugsalai municipal corporation and mango notified area committee.
in 1945, tata motors was setup here. it is now the second largest industry in jamshedpur. a municipal corporation was proposed in 2005 but after protests from the residents this did not happen.
