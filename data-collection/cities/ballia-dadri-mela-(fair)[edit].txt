dadri mela is the second largest cattle fair of india, which is held 5 km (3.1 mi) from ballia town, near nh 31 and 3 km (1.9 mi) from the bus station of ballia city. the fair starts with people taking a holy dip in the river ganges on the full moon of kartik poornima (october–november). this fair is held annually in the honour of dardar muni, the disciple of maharishi bhrigu.
this one-month-long fair is organised in two phases. the first phase starts ten days before the onset of kartik poornima, during which traders bring some excellent breeds of cattle from across india for sale/purchase. on or after kartik poornima, various cultural programs are organised and one can find here a large number of makeshift shops of various items during the next fortnight.
