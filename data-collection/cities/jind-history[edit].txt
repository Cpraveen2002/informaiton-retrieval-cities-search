history[edit]
jind is listed in the ain-i-akbari as a pargana under the sarkar of hisar, producing a revenue of 5,401,749 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 4000 infantry and 500 cavalry. under its entry, the author abu'l-fazl ibn mubarak mentioned the hindu temple in the nearby village of pandu pindara.
in 1775, gajpat singh sidhu built the jind fort, which later came under queen jind kaur, queen of naresh swarup singh sidhu - the jat ruler of jind state.
the jat ruler maharaja gajpat singh, the great-grandson of chaudhary phul singh sidhu and the founder of the phulkian misl, established an independent sikh kingdom by seizing a large tract of the country with sikh armed forces, which included the territory occupied by the present district of jind from the afghan governor zain khan in 1763. in 1775, maharaja established jind as the capital of the state in 1776. it was under the suzerainity of the marathas for much of the 18th century. sangrur was chosen later as the capital of jind state by raja sangat singh (reigned 1822 to 1834). after independence, jind state was merged with the indian union and the territory of the district became part of the sangrur district of the patiala and east punjab states union on 15 july 1948. on 1 november 1966, sangrur district was divided in two and the jind and narwana tehsils were merged to form the jind district. this was one of the seven districts of the newly formed haryana state. the jind tehsil was bifurcated further into two tehsils: jind and safidon in 1967.
