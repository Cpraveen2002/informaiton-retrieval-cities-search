berhampore was fortified in 1757 by the east india company, after the battle of plassey in june 1757, and it continued as a cantonment until 1870. but the foundation of the city of berhampore remains questionable.
karnasubarna, which is very near to berhampore, has a history dating back to 600 ad. many buildings from the late 1600s can still be seen. it used to be known as brahmapur because many of the brahmin families settled here. the cantonment was constituted as a municipality in 1876 and was the headquarters of murshidabad district. the berhampore college was founded in 1853 and in 1888 made over to a local committee, mainly supported by rani swarnamayi. on 27 february 1857, the first major armed battle of the indian rebellion of 1857 took place in barrack square, berhampore. berhampore was ruled by raja krishnath, his ancestors and successors (he was succeeded by his sister's side of the family as he did not have any direct descendants). in 1901, berhampore had a population of 24,397, and included the ancient town of kasim bazar.
