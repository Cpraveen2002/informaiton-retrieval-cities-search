initially ruled by king khaba, imphal was later ruled by the pakhangba leaders. the clan of the ningthouja tribe originated then. the ningthouja tribe quickly expanded and dominated the region in politics and war. kangla palace was built by king khagemba and his son khunjaoba. the palace was later destroyed by the british during the anglo-manipur war. during the reign of maharaja bhagyachandra, there were a number of burmese invasions. however, the kingdom survived with the help of maharaj gambhir singh.
imphal remained peaceful until 1891, when there were internal differences in the royal family. the british sent j.w. quinton to help but the situation only grew worse and senapati tikendrajit was hanged. the autocratic british behavior made people angry. this resulted in the 1891 anglo-manipur war, which the british won.
the battle of imphal took place between march and july 1944, during world war ii. the japanese had invaded imphal to destroy allied forces and then invade india, but they were defeated and forced to retreat. the attack made the british realise the militarily strategic position of imphal.
