infrastructure[edit]
noida ranks one of the cleanest medium population cities when it comes to cleanliness among cities in india. the creation of associated physical infrastructure is higher in noida and greater noida. most of the land in noida is not very fertile and the agricultural output is low. it is in the flood plains of the yamuna river on one side and the hindon river on the other. many villages are visible from the noida expressway, beginning from the mahamaya flyover to greater noida on both sides. one end of the taj expressway terminates on noida expressway near the hindon river and the other at agra. up until the 1980s, these villages were flooded every 2–3 years, resulting in people temporarily moving to other places in noida, and even as far as mehrauli in south delhi. noida is also famous for its tall buildings and comes 2nd in india after mumbai in this parameter.
there is always a huge amount of revenue surplus each year as they are unable to spend the entire amount on development or on maintaining civic amenities. lease rent and interest from builders are the biggest contributors to noida's revenue. besides, the authority gets huge revenues out of water and property transfer charges. "the noida authority had deposited ₹3,500 crore as fixed deposits in various banks because of surplus funds. noida has so much surplus funds with it that it can run the city even if it does not take any taxes from its allottees for 5 years in a row."
a 300 m (980 ft) tall skyscraper named "supernova spira" stands on the noida side of delhi noida border. it will be the tallest residential tower in northern india after its completion in 2021.
