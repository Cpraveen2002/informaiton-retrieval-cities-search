over the years, bilaspur has developed many 4 – lane and 6 – lane roads, street lighting and squares. however, the last decade has seen large-scale unregulated urbanization and residential and commercial expansion, over-straining the water resources and generally defunct civic amenities due to indifferent officials and politicians. there is a master plan for the city and surrounding areas.
electricity is government-regulated and, as of now, no power cuts are effected, thanks to the massive expansion in energy generating capacity both by public and private companies in the energy sector.
