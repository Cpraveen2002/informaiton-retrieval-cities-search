the need for a centralized hospital at khargpur was also felt in the late 19th century. subsequently, a hospital with complete medical facilities was established in 1897. dr arthur martin-leake, victorian cross winner was appointed as chief medical officer of kharagpur hospital in 1904. however the town still needs good private hospitals and advanced medication and healthcare facilities as in current situation its citizens have to depend on kolkata for treatment, which is at a distance of 132Â km.
today, the railway main hospital and kharagpur sub-divisional hospital (chandmari hospital) are main public sector hospitals in kharagpur. recently, since the city lies at an important junction of state and national highways, a trauma care centre of level - 3 category is being set up in kharagpur sub-divisional hospital. a number of private clinics and nursing homes also operate here.
