flooding
gurgaon is notorious for its urban floods every monsoon. the areas on nh-8 around hero honda chowk, basai, dhankot, sector 37 etc. see massive urban floods and headlines grabbing traffic jams reported widely in news media.  a recent research report puts the blame on the broken natural water body linkage and obstructions in the flow in the city due to frantic construction during the last decades. the huda master drainage lines get choked or burst at the seams. disruptions in the hydrological flow of natural drains and limited drainage capacity are all primary reasons for the floods.
gurgaon's ghata jheel, badshahpur jheel, khandsa talab were linked to najafgarh drain which links to yamuna river, via natural water channels and drains.
as per the ground reports and research, the three natural water bodies are struggling for their existence with encroachments on their lands and natural channels. agencies responsible have tried to create artificial water bodies to compensate,  but the efforts fail due to unpredictable rain and water flow patterns leading to deployment of water pumps to fight the situation.
in 2012 punjab & haryana high court banned ground water usage for construction activity, and ngt has recently reprimanded authorities for drain concretization.
