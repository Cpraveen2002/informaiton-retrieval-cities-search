kolhapur is governed by the kolhapur municipal corporation (kmc). the city is divided into five wards, named with the letters a to e. the corporation provides services such as sewage treatment and free cremation for residents and has made a number of improvements, for example, the kolhapur road project, the anti-encroachment drive to stop illegal building activity encroaching on the city's open spaces, and the suvarna jayanti nagarotthan project to improve roads and storm water management. the kmc faces problems like the civic limits of kolhapur city which have not expanded since 1972, due to which the city cannot benefit from various government schemes.
the kolhapur municipal and regional development authority was established on 16 august 2017. this authority to manage kolhapur city and 42 villages around it was formed for the balanced development of kolhapur city and the neighbouring villages.
