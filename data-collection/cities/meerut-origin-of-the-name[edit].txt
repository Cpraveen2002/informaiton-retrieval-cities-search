meerut
Origin of the name[edit]
origin of the name[edit]
the city may have derived its name from 'mayarashtra' (sanskrit: मयराष्ट्र), the capital of the kingdom of mayasura, mandodari's father and ravana's father-in-law. this name may have mutated to mairashtra, mai-dant-ka-khera, mairaath and eventually meerut.
according to another version, maya(sura), being a distinguished architect, received from king yudhishthira the land on which the city of meerut now stands and he called this place maharashtra, a name which in the course of time became shortened to meerut. tradition also has it that the city formed a part of the dominions of mahipala, the king of indraprastha, and the word meerut is associated with his name.
the meaning of मय is alcohol. it is a production centre of alcohol with factories (sugar mills) producing alcohol, hence the name मय is added from a alcohol production city. (mawana sugar distillary). maykhana is also a word which means bar in hindi. all alcohol was sent to capital delhi and exported all over india. in india, cities are named on their popular produce. hence meerut as a production house of alcohol (मय) is called meerut.
