history[edit]
the town ahmednagar was founded in 1490 by ahmad nizam shah i on the site of a more ancient city, bhingar. with the breakup of the bahmani sultanate, ahmad established a new sultanate in ahmednagar, also known as nizam shahi dynasty.
it was one of the deccan sultanates, which lasted until its conquest by mughal emperor shah jahan in 1636. aurangzeb, the last mughal emperor, who spent the latter years of his reign, 1681â€“1707, in the deccan, died in ahmednagar and is buried at khuldabad, near aurangabad in 1707, with a small monument marking the site.
in 1759, the peshwa of the marathas obtained possession of the place from nizam of hyderabad and in 1795 it was ceded by the peshwa to the maratha chief daulat rao sindhia. ahmednagar was besieged by a british force under richard wellesley and captured. it was afterward restored to the marathas, but again came into the possession of the british in 1817, according to the terms of the treaty of poona, and was known as ahmednuggur.
