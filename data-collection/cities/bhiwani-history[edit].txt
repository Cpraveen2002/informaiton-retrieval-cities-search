etymology[edit]
bhiwani is a corrupted form of bhani. the town was founded by a rajput chief called neem singh. his wife named bhani once saved his life from treachery. consequently, he named the town after her. the corrupted name of the town from bhani to bhiani (natives still use this pronunciation) eventually came to be known as bhiwani. other oral tradition avers that the town is named after the goddess bhavani, the wife of lord shiva.
early modern era[edit]
the old town had a protective wall with 12 gates which are ruined now, including bapora gate to the north-west, rohtak gate to the east, and dadri gate to the south-east. buildings are in jat-rajput architecture with pavilions and carved wood.
samadhi[edit]
samadhi of todar singh,  is a samadhi (shrine) near bichhwa lake. mughal emperor humayun came to charkhi dadri for hunting. bhani singh attacked a nearby baliali village with hymanyu's forces, which resulted in a retaliatory attack on mughal forces by rajputs of bhiwani led by todar singh. rajputs of bhiwani were defeated and todar was killed in the battle. samadhi was built in his memory.
british era[edit]
in 1803, bhiwani was annexed by the british raj from the maratha empire. in 1817, william frazer built a mandi (grain and goods market) here, resulting in the emergence of town as the regional hub of trade.
