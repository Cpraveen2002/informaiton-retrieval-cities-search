jabalpur
History[edit]
history[edit]
mythology describes three asuras (evil spirits) in the jabalpur region, who were defeated by the hindu god shiva. tripurasura being the main asura, gave the city its puranic name tripur tirth. tripuri region corresponds to the ancient chedi kingdom of mahabharata times, to which king shishupala belongs.
ashokan relics dating to 300 bce have been found in rupnath, 84 kilometres (52 mi) north of the city, indicating the presence of the mauryan empire (322 to 185 bce) in the region. when the empire fell, jabalpur became a city-state before coming under the rule of the satavahana dynasty (230 bce to 220 ce). after their reign, the region was ruled locally by the bodhis and the senas, following which it became a vassal state of the gupta empire (320 to 550).
from 675 to 800, the region was ruled by bamraj dev of the kalachuri dynasty from karanbel. the best known kalachuri ruler was yuvraj dev i (r. 915–945), who married nohla devi (a princess of the chalukya dynasty).
one of the kalachuri ministers, golok simha kayastha, was instrumental in founding the chausath yogini temple near bhedaghat. his descendants include bhoj simha, who was the dewan to sangramsahi (r. 1491–1543); dewan adhar simha, who was the prime minister to rani durgavati (r. 1550–1564), and beohar raghuvir sinha, the last jagirdar of jabalpur who reigned until 1947.
gondwana rule[edit]

the gondwana king, raje madan shah madawi of mandla, (r. 1138–1157) built a watchtower and a small hilltop fort at madan mahal, an area in jabalpur. in the 1500s, the gond king, sangram (whose son, raje dalpat shah madawi married rani durgavati) held singaurgarh fort in sangrampur. rani durgawati was a warrior of the gond dynasty, known for her prosperous kingdom. she was well aware of the importance of water conservation and hence she built more than 85 ponds in jabalpur, mainly ranital, haathital, madhatal and hanumantal.
in 1564, during the reign of veer narayan (sangram's grandson), abdul majeed harawi (viceroy of kara-manikpur in the mughal empire) conquered jabalpur and its surrounding areas. however, the mughal supremacy in jabalpur was more nominal than real.
in 1698, the gondwana king, raje hriday shah (r. 1652–1704) moved his court to the mandla fort. he secured water sources and built irrigation structures. later, gondwana was seized by nizam (r. 1753–1780). after nizam, the gondwana kingdom was conquered by the marathas.
maratha rule[edit]
the maratha rulers of sagar, came to power in about 1781. around 1798, the maratha peshwa gave the nerbuddah valley to the bhonsle kings of nagpur, who ruled the area until 1818, when it was seized by the british east india company after the battle of sitabuldi.
