there are two proposals by the puducherry government, firstly to merge pondicherry and oulgaret municipalities, and upgrade the pondicherry municipality into a '"municipal corporation", and secondly to upgrade villianur and ariyankuppam commune panchayats into municipalities, which would increase the pondicherry region's urban area around 155 km (60 sq mi) of the total 292 km (113 sq mi).
