etymology[edit]
there are many theories about the derivation of the name alwar. cunningham holds that the city derived its name from the salva tribe and was originally salwapur, then salwar, halawar and eventually alwar, according to another school it was known as aravalpur or the city of aravali. some others hold that city is named after alaval khan mewati (khanzada prince who wrested alwar from nikumbh rajputs). a research conducted during the reign of maharaja jai singh of alwar revealed that maharaja alaghraj, second son of maharaja kakil of amber. ruled the area in the eleventh century and his territory extended up to the present city of alwar. he founded the city of alpur in 1106 vikrami samvat (1049 a.d.) after his own name which eventually became alwar. it was formerly spelt as ulwar but in the reign of jai singh the spelling was changed to alwar.
