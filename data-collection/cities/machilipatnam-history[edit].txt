the town has existed since at least the 3rd century bce (satavahana period) when, according to ptolemy, it was known as maisolos. the periplus of the erythraean sea calls it masalia in the 1st-century bce. the port is on the southeastern, or coromandel coast, of india. at the mouth of the river krishna on the bay of bengal, the masula port saw flourishing sea trade.
muslin was traded by ancient greeks from the town and the word muslin originated from the name maisolos. muslin was an important source of income for the town, being a favourite of roman traders for domestic consumption. several roman coins were found during excavations of buddhist towns near machilipatnam.
masulipatnam rose to prominence under the qutb shahi kings. the town served as the primary sea port for their dominion, the kingdom of golkonda. it was an outlet for textiles produced in the godavari delta. it was a major source of income for the kingdom, and contributed to its immense prosperity in the 1620s and 1630s.
by the end of the 17th century, the port city had fallen into decline. this coincided with the mughal conquest of golkonda. however, mismanagement prior to the conquest may have also been a factor in the city's decline.
the town was the district headquarters of the then, masulipatnam district and now to the krishna district, which was formed in 1859 in the composite madras state.
