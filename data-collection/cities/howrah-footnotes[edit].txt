footnotes[edit]
^ census data of howrah can be difficult to compare as the city is sometimes grouped together with the kolkata and other settlements as the kolkata metropolitan area. further care needs to be taken to distinguish howrah town from howrah district. it is also worth noting that bally municipality was re-incorporated into howrah in 2015  ^ note that howrah town census area was not stable until 1981
