university[edit]
the university of burdwan was formally inaugurated on 15 june 1960 by sukumar sen, its first vice-chancellor. it was after the abolition of the zamindari system in the fifties that uday chand mahtab, the last representative of the burdwan raj, left almost his entire property in burdwan to the state government. this, coupled with the initiative of the then chief minister of west bengal, bidhan chandra roy, facilitated the establishment of this university. presently, the administrative works are mostly done at the rajbati (the palace of barddhamana maharaja) campus; on the other hand, academic activities centre on the golapbag campus. with social responsibilities in mind, the university actively patronised the construction of a science centre and the meghnad saha planetarium.
