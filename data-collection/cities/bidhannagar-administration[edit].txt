ultimately in 1995, bidhannagar got its own elected body called bidhannagar municipality consisting of 23 wards (later increased to 25 wards). all the plots of land in bidhanannagar are leasehold plots and the urban development department (the lessor) directly manages the land matters. east kolkata wetlands area is also included in bidhannagar municipality. the proposal for the merger of bidhannagar municipality with the kolkata municipal corporation has been periodically mooted since 2011, but never realised due to different custodian of land and property tax-structures. kolkata airport, rajarhat-gopalpur (kaikhali, teghoria, baguiati, hatiara, kestopur), parts of south dum dum (dum dum park, bangur avenue, lake town) and bidhannagar municipality are already brought together under the jurisdiction of the bidhannagar police commissionerate. on 18 june 2015, bidhannagar municipal corporation (bmc) was constituted by merging the existing municipal areas of bidhannagar municipality, rajarhat-gopalpur municipality and the panchayat area of mahishbathan ii gram panchayat. now bidhannagar municipality has 14 wards (ward no. 28 to 41) under bidhannagar municipal corporation.
