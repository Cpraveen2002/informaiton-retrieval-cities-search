etymology
ancient travellers and tradesmen referred to kochi, variously alluding to it as cocym, cochym, cochin, and kochi. the cochin jewish community called cochin kogin (hebrew: קוגין), which is seen in the seal of the synagogue owned by the community. the arab merchants called this place kashi, which is seen in the books such as tuhfat ul mujahideen. the origin of the name kochi is thought to be the malayalam word kochu azhi, meaning 'small lagoon'. accounts by italian explorers nicolo conti (15th century), and fra paoline in the 17th century say that it was called kochchi, named after the river connecting the backwaters to the sea. after the arrival of the portuguese, and later the british, the name cochin stuck as the official appellation. the city reverted to a closer transcription of its original malayalam name, kochi, in 1996. this change in name was challenged by the city municipal corporation but court later dismissed the plea.
