the architecture of the city is a blend of gothic revival, indo-saracenic, art deco, and other contemporary styles. most of the buildings during the british period, such as the victoria terminus and bombay university, were built in gothic revival style. their architectural features include a variety of european influences such as german gables, dutch roofs, swiss timbering, romance arches, tudor casements, and traditional indian features. there are also a few indo-saracenic styled buildings such as the gateway of india. art deco styled landmarks can be found along the marine drive and west of the oval maidan. mumbai has the second largest number of art deco buildings in the world after miami. in the newer suburbs, modern buildings dominate the landscape. mumbai has by far the largest number of skyscrapers in india, with 956 existing skyscrapers and 272 under construction as of 2009.
